How to Use the AU Bank Home Loan Interest Rate EMI Calculator Go to the top of the page and follow these steps to use the AU Bank Home Loan EMI Calculator: First, just put in how much you want to borrow. Next, enter the interest rate for your loan (it might change depending on the offer you get). Next, decide on the loan term that works best for you. If you're planning to make any extra payments, add that amount. Don’t forget to include any processing fees if there are any. Tap on the ‘Calculate’ button to see your EMI. Once the results pop up, you’ll see: Your monthly EMI. The total amount you borrowed. How much interest you'll end up paying over time. Any pre-payment you’ve made (if applicable). And the total amount you'll pay, including the principal, interest, and any pre-payments. Plus, it’ll show how much of your loan has already been paid off. It’s pretty simple to follow, and the results give you a clear picture of what to expect. How to Calculate AU Bank Home Loan EMI? For those who prefer a hands-on approach, you can calculate your EMI using the following formula: Document The EMI calculation is based on a standard mathematical formula: EMI = P × r × (1+ r ) n (1+ r ) n -1 Where: PPP is the principal loan amount r is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12 and then by 100) n is the loan tenure in months (loan tenure in years multiplied by 12) Explanation with an Example
Let’s consider an example to illustrate the calculation: Loan Amount (P): ₹35,00,000 Annual Interest Rate: 8% Loan Tenure: 20 years Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 8 12 × 100 = 0.006666 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 20 × 12 = 240 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 35,00,000 × 0.006666 × (1+0.006666) <5sup>240 ( 1+0.006666 ) 240 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 35,00,000 × 0.006666 × 4.926019 4.926019 - 1 EMI = 1,14,928.949289 3.926019 EMI ≈ ₹29,275 So, the monthly EMI for a loan amount of ₹35,00,000 at an 8% annual interest rate over 20 years would be approximately ₹29,275.

What is the Axis Bank Home Loan EMI Calculator? Axis Bank's Home Loan EMI Calculator is a free online tool designed to help you estimate your monthly loan repayments (Equated Monthly Instalments or EMIs) before you apply for a home loan. It simplifies the process of understanding how much your monthly payments might be based on the following factors you input: Loan Amount: Enter the desired amount you want to borrow for your home purchase. Interest Rate: While the calculator provides a range, you can also input a specific interest rate you may have been pre-approved for, or one based on your research of current offerings. Loan Tenure: This refers to the total duration of your loan, typically ranging from 5 to 30 years. By providing this information, the calculator generates an estimated EMI amount, offering a quick snapshot of your potential monthly financial commitment. What is Axis Bank Home Loan Interest Rate?

Interest Rates: Competitive interest rates are crucial for keeping your home loan manageable. Axis Bank offers both floating and fixed interest rate options. Floating rates can fluctuate with market conditions, but may be attractive if you anticipate interest rates to drop. Fixed rates offer peace of mind with a stable EMI throughout the loan term. 3.

To make things easier for you, we, at Jupiter have created a comprehensive Home Loan Interest Rate EMI Calculator that enables you to calculate your EMI across multiple banks and lenders effortlessly. Simply scroll to the top of this page, use our calculator, and input your details as instructed below. Once completed, your EMI and other significant parameters will be displayed automatically. Step 1: Input Your Loan Amount Enter the desired loan amount you plan to borrow from Axis Bank for your home purchase. This amount will directly impact your EMI. Step 2: Set the Interest Rate You can enter a specific interest rate based on your research of current AXIS Bank offerings or from your discussions with the bank when requesting a pre-approval quote. Step 3: Determine Your Loan Tenure Select the loan term (number of years) over which you plan to repay the loan. Axis Bank typically offers home loan tenures ranging from 5 to 30 years. Choosing a longer tenure will result in lower EMIs but spread the interest payments over a longer period. Conversely, a shorter tenure will mean higher EMIs but allows you to be debt-free sooner. Step 4: Get Your EMI Details Once you've entered your desired loan amount, interest rate, and loan tenure, the calculator will instantly calculate your estimated monthly EMI. This figure represents the fixed amount you'll pay towards your loan each month, including both principal repayment and interest charges. Step 5: Analyze and Adjust The calculator also offers an amortization schedule, which provides a detailed breakdown of how your EMI amount is divided between principal and interest over the entire loan tenure. Based on this data, you can further adjust the loan amounts, interest rates, and repayment durations to find what best suits your budget. Make wise decisions before finalizing your home loan application with our home loan EMI calculator. How to Calculate Axis Bank Home Loan EMI? While the easiest and fastest way to determine your Axis Bank Home Loan EMI is to use our online calculator, for those who prefer a manual approach, here's the formula you can use: Document The EMI calculation is based on a standard mathematical formula: EMI = P × r × (1+ r ) n (1+ r ) n -1 Where: PPP is the principal loan amount r is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12 and then by 100) n is the loan tenure in months (loan tenure in years multiplied by 12) Explanation with an Example
Let’s consider an example to illustrate the calculation: Loan Amount (P): ₹35,00,000 Annual Interest Rate: 8.70% Loan Tenure: 30 years Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 8.75 12 × 100 = 0.00729 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 30 × 12 = 360 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 35,00,000 × 0.00729 × (1+0.00729) 360 ( 1+0.00729 ) 360 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 35,00,000 × 0.00729 × 13.6704 13.6704 - 1 EMI = 348848.1024 12.6704 EMI ≈ ₹27,535 So, the monthly EMI for a loan amount of ₹35,00,000 at an 8.75% annual interest rate over 30 years would be approximately ₹27,535.

The Bank of India (BOI) offers a free online tool, the BOI Home Loan EMI Calculator, to help you navigate this process. This calculator estimates your monthly EMI ( Equated Monthly Instalment ) – the amount you'd pay towards your home loan each month. But it does more than just calculate a number. The BOI Home Loan EMI Calculator can be a useful tool to understand how much you can afford to borrow.  By entering details like the loan amount, interest rate, and desired loan term, you can get a clearer picture of your monthly payments.  This information helps you make informed decisions about how much you can borrow and choose a loan that fits your budget and financial goals. The BOI Home Loan EMI Calculator isn't just for basic calculations. You can also use it to explore different loan options . For example, you can see how a slightly higher interest rate would affect your EMI, or how extending your loan term would change your monthly payment. This can help you find the best loan strategy for your situation. What is the Interest Rate of a BOI Home Loan? While rates can start from as low as 8.40% per year, they may be higher depending on your situation. For example, borrowers with a CIBIL score below 675 might see rates starting from 10.70% and potentially go even higher. The interest rate for a BOI Home Loan can vary depending on your creditworthiness, the specific loan program you choose, and other factors like your employment. What are the Different Types of BOI Home Loans? Bank of India offers several home loan options to suit your needs: BOI Star Home Loan Star Diamond Home Loan BOI Star Smart Home Loan BOI Star Top-Up Loan BOI Star Pravasi Home Loan Scheme It's a good idea to explore these options to find the best fit for your situation. Bank of India may also offer personalised home loan plans.  To discuss your specific requirements and choose the most suitable option, consider contacting a BOI agent. Key Features of BOI Home Loans 1. Extended Repayment Tenure: BOI allows you to repay your home loan over a maximum period of 30 years (360 months). This gives you more time to manage your monthly payments comfortably. 2. Moratorium Period: During the initial stages of construction, you might not have any income from the property. BOI offers a moratorium period of up to 36 months where you can delay your EMI payments (interest will still accrue). 3. Competitive Rates: BOI's home loan rates start at Rs. 755 per lakh, which can help you save money on your overall loan cost. 4. Combined Income Eligibility: If you need additional borrowing power, BOI considers the income of a close relative as a co-applicant, increasing your eligibility for a larger loan amount. 3. Overdraft Facility: The Star Smart Home Loan option allows you to convert your loan into an overdraft facility, providing additional flexibility to access funds as needed. 4. Financing Options: BOI offers a variety of loan purposes beyond just purchasing a finished home. You can use your BOI Home Loan to finance the purchase of a plot for future construction (within 5 years), renovate or extend an existing property, or even furnish your new home. 5. Loan Top-Ups: Need additional funds after your initial loan amount? BOI allows you to easily top up your existing loan for unforeseen expenses. 6. Green Financing: Considering installing solar panels for your new home? BOI includes the cost of solar panel purchase within your home loan amount, making it easier to invest in sustainable solutions. 7. Simplified Loan Process: BOI considers the insurance premium for your property as part of the project cost, streamlining the loan application process. 8. Flexible Repayment Options: In some cases, BOI might offer you the option to adjust your EMI amount over the loan term, providing additional flexibility for managing your repayments. How to Use BOI Home Loan Interest Rate EMI Calculator? To make things easier for you, we at Jupiter have created a comprehensive Home Loan Interest Rate EMI Calculator that enables you to effortlessly calculate your EMI across multiple banks and lenders. Simply scroll to the top of this page, use our calculator, and input your loan details as instructed below. Once completed, your EMI and other significant parameters will be displayed automatically. 1. Input Your Loan Details: The calculator will typically require you to enter the following information: Loan Amount: Enter the desired amount you wish to borrow for your home purchase. Tenure: Select the loan repayment period that best suits your financial plan. BOI home loans typically range from 5 to 30 years. Rate of Interest: Enter the estimated interest rate based on your research or the bank's current offerings. Adjust this field to explore various scenarios with different potential interest rates. 2. Calculate Your EMI: Once you've entered all the details, the calculator will display your estimated monthly EMI amount. This represents the fixed amount you'll pay towards your loan every month throughout the chosen tenure. 3. Explore Different Loan Scenarios: Experiment with various loan amounts, interest rates, and repayment tenures to find the combination that best suits your financial situation and affordability.  This allows you to compare different loan options and make well-informed decisions before finalizing your home loan application. How to Calculate BOI Home Loan EMI? To calculate your home loan, the fastest and most convenient option is to use our online EMI calculators. These user-friendly tools typically require just three inputs as mentioned earlier. For those who prefer a hands-on approach, you can calculate your EMI using the following formula: Document The EMI calculation is based on a standard mathematical formula: EMI = P × r × (1+ r ) n (1+ r ) n -1 Where: PPP is the principal loan amount r is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12 and then by 100) n is the loan tenure in months (loan tenure in years multiplied by 12) Explanation with an Example
Let’s consider an example to illustrate the calculation: Loan Amount (P): ₹30,00,000 Annual Interest Rate: 8.40% Loan Tenure: 30 years Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 8.40 12 × 100 = 0.007 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 30 × 12 = 360 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 30,00,000 × 0.007 × (1+0.007) 360 ( 1+0.007 ) 360 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 30,00,000 × 0.007 × 12.3199 12.3199 - 1 EMI = 2581717.9 11.3199 EMI ≈ ₹22,855 So, the monthly EMI for a loan amount of ₹30,00,000 at an 8.40% annual interest rate over 30 years would be approximately ₹22,855. What are the Benefits of Using a BOI Home Loan EMI Calculator? 1. Crystal-Clear EMI Estimates: No more guesswork! The calculator factors in the loan amount, interest rate, and loan term to provide a clear picture of your monthly EMI payment.  This allows you to confidently establish a realistic price range for your dream home. 2. Budgeting with Confidence: Knowing your EMI in advance is like having a roadmap for your finances. You can use this information to create a realistic monthly budget, taking into account your income, living expenses, and now, your future home loan payment. This promotes financial stability and helps you assess the feasibility of the loan based on your current situation. 3. Eligibility Assessment: Unsure about the loan amount you might qualify for? The calculator's eligibility function can provide valuable insights. By entering your income and existing financial obligations, it can estimate the loan amount you might be eligible for based on BOI's lending criteria. This helps you set realistic expectations and tailor your home search accordingly. 4. Understanding Your Loan Breakdown: The EMI calculator goes beyond just the monthly payment. It unveils the amortization schedule, which breaks down each EMI into its principal and interest components. This transparency allows you to understand how much of your payment goes towards reducing the loan amount and how much goes towards interest. 5. Strategise for Early Payoff: The amortization schedule becomes a valuable tool when planning for prepayments. You can analyse the impact of lump sum payments or increased monthly payments, empowering you to save on interest and potentially shorten the loan term, saving you money in the long run.

This blog post introduces you to Canara Bank's Home Loan EMI calculator, a valuable tool that allows you to estimate your monthly payments. By using this calculator, you can confidently navigate the home-buying process with a clear understanding of your financial obligations. What is the Canara Bank Home Loan EMI Calculator? The Canara Bank Home Loan EMI Calculator is a free online tool that helps you estimate your monthly Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI) payment for a Canara Bank home loan. It simplifies the process of understanding your future financial commitment by taking into account three key factors: Loan Amount: This is the total amount of money you borrow from the bank to finance your property purchase. Loan Tenure: This represents the total duration of your loan, typically ranging from 5 to 30 years. Interest Rate: This is the annual percentage rate charged by Canara Bank on your home loan. It significantly impacts your overall repayment amount. By plugging in these values, the calculator performs a complex mathematical calculation to estimate your EMI. This gives you a clear picture of your monthly financial commitment towards the home loan. What is Canara Bank Home Loan Interest Rate? Canara Bank offers home loans with interest rates that start at 9.25% and go up to 12%. The specific interest rate you'll qualify for depends on several factors, including the type of home loan program you choose, your employment status (whether you're salaried or self-employed), and your credit history. Since these factors can vary significantly from person to person, it's difficult to say definitively what rate you might be offered. What are the Different Types of Canara Bank Home Loans? Canara Bank offers a variety of home loan options to suit your needs: Canara Bank Housing Loan Canara Kuteer Scheme Agriculturist's Housing Loans NRI Home Loans from Canara Bank Canara Bank Home Loan Plus Canara Bank Plot Loan Home Improvement Loan Super Gain Home Loan Scheme - Canara Bank Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna What are the Key Features of Canara Bank Home Loan Canara Bank offers a comprehensive home loan program to suit various needs.

Wide Range of Uses: The loan can be used for various purposes, including purchasing a ready-made house or flat, constructing a new one on owned land, or even buying a plot and building your dream home. Additionally, Canara Bank offers loans for repairs and renovations up to Rs. 15 lakh, helping you upgrade your existing space. 2. Existing Loan Transfer: If you have a home loan with another bank or financial institution, Canara Bank allows you to transfer the existing liability to their program. This can potentially simplify your finances and potentially offer more favourable terms. 3. Flexible Loan Amounts: Canara Bank doesn't have a pre-defined maximum loan amount. This means they can potentially cater to a wider range of property values. Additionally, they offer high loan-to-income ratios for both salaried and non-salaried individuals, allowing you to borrow a larger sum relative to your earnings. 4. Competitive Processing Fees: The standard processing fee is relatively low at 0.50% of the loan amount, with a minimum charge and a maximum cap. They also occasionally offer special promotions with a 50% discount on these fees, making the upfront cost even more attractive. 5. Long Repayment Tenure: Canara Bank allows you to spread your loan repayment over a long period, offering maximum tenures of up to 30 years.

Reasonable Down Payment: The margin requirement, which is the difference between the property value and the loan amount you can borrow, ranges from 10% to 25%. This percentage varies depending on the total loan amount and the age of the property. A lower margin translates to a smaller down payment, potentially making the upfront cost more manageable. 7.

Our Chai Sutta Calculator will surely help you identify the expense! Welcome to Jupiter's Chai Sutta Calculator - The only tool that talks about our biggest addiction and helps more innovative financial planning! Why Chai Sutta Calculator? It's for a simple reason - We know you, too, are losing your savings without even realizing it, so we are here to pull your attention. But, Don't panic as it's a problem for many! 'I earn quite well, but where are all my funds? 'The question troubles us all at some or the other time. Yet, we ignore it and repeat the same things over and over again. We waste a lot of our hard-earned money on needless things like consuming fast food more often or subscribing to newspapers and magazines that we don't even heed. But thankfully, we are not alone as the universal problem is due to the ' Latte Factor .' What is the Latte Factor? The Latte Factor is when you waste money regularly through small and insignificant expenses. These expenditures pile up over time and wipe off a lot of your reserves. However, the worldwide phenomenon is seen in many ways. It is much more than just a Latte or a punch of caffeine. The Latte effect can be found in all the unnecessary periodic spending. Nevertheless, the Latte Factor does not focus on taking out the fun of your life; instead, it suggests some intelligent ways to get the same value but at fewer costs. For example, when talking about tea and cigarettes, we all enjoy a cup of tea(chai) or our daily 'Chai ki Chuski' and sometimes a sutta(cigarette) to complement our per diem tea. Though Its daily expense does not seem much to many of us, the Latte Effect is shown here. What if we tell you that you are spending a large sum of your income on just chai and sutta? Yes, you are caught up here! When you sum up these small expenses, you will be shocked to see the amount you spend daily for the same. The theory tells you that you are richer than you believe, and when you cut these unnecessary expenses, you will be able to accumulate a lot of your wealth. However, this doesn't mean that you should stop drinking tea; rather, you should find a way to avoid the expenditure, i.e., either you go for an electric kettle and curb the daily spending, or you can lessen the number of times you take a tea break. There are many more ways to cut the costs, but first, you need to calculate the Latte Effect and Jupiter's Chai Sutta Calculator is a perfect choice here. Jupiter's Chai Sutta Calculator Jupiter's Chai Sutta Calculator calculates your total spending on tea and cigarettes. The tool gives you the annual amount and the total percentage of your income that you spend on them. It asks for inputs like your monthly income, the number of cigarettes you have(if any), the number of cups of tea per day, and other unimportant expenditures to complement the daily ritual and their costs. Once you enter the correct inputs, the calculator will instantly estimate the total expenditure. Working of Jupiter's Chai Sutta Calculator Let us understand the working of Jupiter's Chai Sutta Calculator with the help of an example. Suppose you drink 4 cups of tea daily on a wayside stall with 2 cigarettes. The tea costs Rs 12 per cup and a cigarette for Rs 15. Petty expenditures with chai and sutta are almost Rs 20 per day, and your monthly income is Rs 40,000. The Chai Sutta Calculator will show your annual chai sutta expense as Rs 35,770, which is almost your monthly pay. Aren't the numbers blowing? After all, who knew that these negligible expenditures had a massive physical and financial impact? How does Jupiter's Chai Sutta Calculator help me? The Chai Sutta Calculator by Jupiter gives you an idea of how much you spend daily on inessential items. The tool is just to open your eyes so you can plan your finances better and go for a personal spending discipline. Here are some tips you can use to inculcate the habit. Keep track of your income and expenses. For this, you can maintain a notebook or an online sheet to record your daily expenditures and design a personal budget. This way, you can save a lot at the month's end. Use Jupiter's Chai Sutta Calculator more frequently to keep track of your latte effect. Also, compare your outlay from time to time and boost up your savings. You can also go for online payments that will record all your transactions and cut your expenses accordingly. Prioritize your everyday expenditures and find a way to cut the gratuitous causes. Jupiter's Chai Sutta Calculator will not make you rich but will help you save a whole lot of your money by estimating your unnecessary spending. Get smarter with the online tool and begin your journey to financial stability today! FAQs 1. What is the Latte Factor? The Latte Factor calculates the small unnecessary spending that leads to greater money wash. 2. How can I calculate the Latte effect? You can use Jupiter's Chai Sutta Calculator to calculate the latte effect and curb unnecessary expenses. 3. How will Jupiter's Chai Sutta Calculator help me? The online tool estimates unidentified spending and calculates your latte factor for tea and cigarettes. In this article Calculators Similar articles that might interest you!

A Credit Card EMI allows users to convert a large purchase made with a credit card into smaller, more manageable monthly installments. Instead of paying the full amount at once, you can chose to repay the amount in parts. Your bank will provide the feature to pay the amount back over a predefined tenure with applicable interest rate. What is a Credit Card EMI Calculator? A Credit Card EMI Calculator is a tool that helps you figure out how much you will pay each month if you convert a large purchase on your credit card into EMIs (Equated Monthly Installments). How it works: When you buy a product like a laptop, phone or an appliance— you don’t always have to pay the full amount upfront. Some banks offer EMI option on your Credit Card payment. With EMI, you can break the total cost into smaller monthly payments over a set period. However, the bank charges interest on this amount, which increases the total amount you’ll pay, but helps you pay the smaller amount at the time of purchase. Here are some of the terms that you will come across: Principal Amount (P) : The total purchase amount converted to EMI. Interest Rate (r) : Annual or monthly interest rate charged on the EMI. Tenure (n) : The duration (in months) over which the EMI is paid. EMI : The fixed monthly payment made by the user. Document The EMI calculation is based on a standard mathematical formula: EMI = P × r × (1+ r ) n (1+ r ) n -1 Where: PPP is the principal loan amount r is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12 and then by 100) n is the loan tenure in months (loan tenure in years multiplied by 12) Let’s consider an example to understand the calculation: Loan Amount (P): ₹55,000 Annual Interest Rate: 16% Loan Tenure: 1 year Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 16 12 × 100 = 0.01333 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 1 × 12 = 12 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 55,000 × 0.01333 × (1+0.01333) 12 ( 1+0.01333 ) 12 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 1,00,000 × 0.01333 × 1.1718 1.1718 - 1 EMI = 857.1717 0.1718 EMI ≈ ₹4,990 In this article Calculators Similar articles that might interest you!

Whether you want to buy a home or car or wish to go on your dream vacation, you can finance it with housing, automobile, or personal loan, respectively. These funds are available for a specific period and entail a certain rate of interest. Several parameters including loan tenure, interest rate, and amount determine the repayment installment. Most lenders provide online calculators that allow you to determine the approximate monthly installment payable. These calculators are easy to use and provide instant results, allowing you to make informed decisions. What is an EMI calculator? Most loans are repaid in equated monthly installments (EMIs). Knowing the approximate EMI amount you will have to pay can help you plan your finances well. This ensures you have no difficulty in making payments on time. An online EMI calculator can be beneficial in understanding the estimated installment and help you make an informed financial decision. How to calculate EMI Online EMI is the monthly installment you pay the lender over the loan tenure until the entire amount is fully repaid. The EMI comprises the principal repayment and the interest. Generally, the total amount of the principal and interest is divided by the loan duration to calculate the monthly installment. Often, the interest component in the EMI is higher during the initial loan tenure and it gradually decreases over a period. Although the EMI remains constant during the entire loan duration, the allocation towards principal repayment and interest changes with every repayment. Formula to calculate EMI online for a personal loan, home loan, and car loan The mathematical formula of calculating the EMI is as follows: E = P * r * (1+r) ^ n / [(1+r) ^ (n - 1)] where E is the EMI P is the loan principal amount r is the rate of interest n is the loan duration For example, if you borrow INR 5 lakhs for a period of three years at an 8.5% per annum rate of interest, the EMI is INR 15,784. Let us use the above formula to calculate the approximate EMIs on different types of loans. Using an online personal loan EMI calculator, here is the breakdown between principal and interest payment. Loan Amount INR 5,00,000 Loan Tenure 3 years Rate of Interest 14% per annum Total Interest INR 1,15,204 EMI Amount INR 17,089 The table below shows the breakdown for a housing loan using a home loan EMI calculator: Loan Amount INR 50,00,000 Loan Tenure 20 years Rate of Interest 7.1% per annum Total Interest INR 43,75,840 EMI Amount INR 39,066 Let us now look at the approximate EMI for an auto loan using an online car loan EMI calculator. Loan Amount INR 7,00,000 Loan Tenure 5 years Rate of Interest 8.2% per annum Total Interest INR 1,55,660 EMI Amount INR 14,261 The above calculations are based on no prepayment or delays. If you decide to partially prepay some of the outstanding loan amount, the EMI will change, and you can check this by adjusting the amount you want to prepay. You will also be able to see the total interest you can save by prepaying some part of the principal loan amount. How is an Online EMI calculator used? You can easily find an EMI calculator online that not only provides instant results but also shows the breakdown between principal repayment and interest amount paid over the loan duration. The calculator can be used to know the estimated installment for all types of credit facilities, such as home, car, or personal loans. To calculate the EMI, you must enter the loan amount, the rate of interest, and the tenure (either in years or months, or both). Once you enter the relevant information, the EMI amount is reflected. Additionally, you will see a pie chart that shows the breakdown in percentage between the principal repayment and the interest amount, which allows you to determine your total interest outflow over the loan duration. What are the benefits of using an EMI calculator? Before you avail of a loan, whether secured or unsecured, having an idea of the approximate monthly installment is beneficial. It will not only help you determine if you can afford the loan or not but also allow you to plan your monthly finances to avoid a liquidity crunch. Here are four benefits of using an online loan EMI calculator: With an almost accurate EMI amount, you can plan your finances better and ensure the debt-to-income ratio is below 50% to avoid any stress. You do not have to do the manual calculation to determine the EMI, which reduces your time and effort. The possibility of any errors is completely eliminated as the entire calculation is automated. The calculation is specific for every type of loan, which means the home loan EMI breakdown differs from that of a car loan or a personal loan. Frequently asked questions (FAQs) What types of loans can you use the EMI calculator for? You can use these online EMI calculators for all types of credit facilities, which include personal, automobile, and home loans. What is comprised in the EMI? Some portion of the EMI is used towards the principal repayment and the balance towards the interest. Often, the interest component is higher during the initial period and reduces as you continue making the payments. What happens if the interest rate increases or decreases during the loan duration? If your loan is based on a floating interest rate and it decreases during the tenure, a higher portion of the EMI is used towards principal repayment, thereby reducing the loan tenure. In comparison, if the interest rate increases during the loan duration, a higher component is used towards interest, thus marginally impacting its tenure. How to use an EMI calculator? To use a calculator, you need to input the loan amount in Rupees, the rate of interest in percentage, and the loan duration in years or months, or both. Using this data, the calculator instantly gives you the total interest and the EMI amount. Is the installment amount calculated using the EMI calculator the same as that determined by the lender? When the lender approves your loan application, the exact EMI may vary slightly from the one calculated using an online calculator. The difference may arise due to the actual rate of interest charged by the lender and the processing fees levied. Can the EMI amount change over the loan tenure? Lenders offer a floating rate of interest for home and business loans and any change in the interest rate can impact your EMI. Sometimes, the lenders may maintain the same installment amount while adjusting the loan duration. The EMI can also change if you make a partial prepayment on the outstanding loan amount. When do you have to pay the EMI after availing of a loan? The lender will provide an EMI schedule at the time of disbursement. The EMI is due on a particular date of the month, which is pre-determined when you receive the loan approval. What happens if you do not pay the EMI on time? If you miss an EMI payment on the due date, the lender may levy a late payment fee. Additionally, it is reflected on your credit history and can negatively impact your credit score. Is it good to pre-close the loan before the end of its duration? Lenders may charge a prepayment penalty if you repay the entire amount before its due date. Pre-closure may also negatively impact your credit score. However, it is recommended you make partial prepayments whenever you have some extra cash to reduce the total interest outflow. What factors affect the EMI amount? Before you avail of a loan, having an idea of the approximate EMI can help you understand the approximate monthly outflow and allow you to plan your finances to avoid any liquidity crunch. The following factors impact the EMI amount. Loan amount, which is one of the most important factors, and choosing the amount wisely, is advisable. Interest rate also determines the EMI and the higher the rate, the greater will be the outflow. Therefore, comparing different products offered by various lenders to find the most competitive rate is recommended. Loan duration, any increase or decrease in the tenure impacts the EMI. The longer the duration the higher will be your interest and total outflow and vice versa. Are home, car, and personal loan calculators the same? Most online calculators use the loan amount, rate of interest, and duration to calculate the EMI. However, some calculators may restrict the total loan amount depending on the type of loan you are applying for. In this article Calculators Similar articles that might interest you!

The Employee Provident Fund (EPF), also known as Provident Fund (PF) , is a retirement benefit scheme that private sector companies offer to their employees. This scheme comes under the Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, to ensure the financial security of private-sector employees. The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) regulates the scheme. Under this structure, both employers and employees contribute an equal amount to the fund. Simply put, you invest a portion of your monthly salary in the PF, and your employer adds the same value to the fund. You receive the income generated from the PF after retirement. Thus, EPF assists in providing financial security even after retirement or loss of employment. Read on to learn how to calculate the proceedings from your PF account using our PF Calculator . What Is PF Calculator? Our calculator will help you determine the amount of money generated by your  EPF and how much you can expect to get at retirement. Our online EPF  calculator : Eliminates the need for calculating the PF amount manually every month. Eliminates the need of tracking changes in the PF interest rate as our calculator uses the current rate automatically. Informs you about any recent changes, contributions, or transactions after every use. Our notifications help you stay up-to-date with the PF account and any regulation introduced by the EPFO. It comes with the assurance that the information regarding your EPF remains accurate every time. How to Calculate EPF? Before understanding the formula used for our EPF calculator, you need to have an idea about a few details, such as the basic monthly salary and Dearness Allowance (DA) , your EPF contribution percentage, the employer’s contribution, and the interest rate. To explain the PF calculation formula, let us assume that your basic monthly salary with Dearness Allowance (DA) is ₹15,000, your contribution to EPF is 12% of the amount, and the employer’s contribution towards EPF is 3.67%. The employers invest the remaining 8.33% in the Employee Pension Scheme. As per the above illustration: Your contribution to the EPF will be 12% of ₹15,000 = ₹1,800 Your employer’s investment in EPS will be 8.33% of ₹ 15,000 = ₹1,250 Your employer’s contribution towards EPF will be your contribution minus the employer’s contribution towards the EPS = ₹1,800 - ₹1,250 = ₹550 Hence, the total monthly contribution to the PF account will be ₹1,800 + ₹550 = ₹2,350 With the current yearly interest rate of 8.5%, you will get a monthly interest rate of 8.50%/12 = 0.70% (approximately). The value of the PF fund on your joining month will be ₹2,350, as the employers do not pay any interest for the first month. The following month, the total contribution will become ₹2,350 + ₹2,350 = ₹4,700. You will also receive an interest of ₹4,700 x 0.7083% = ₹33.29. The PF calculation uses the same formula for the subsequent months. Benefits of EPF Scheme Some of the essential features and benefits of EPF include: You can avail of its multiple tax exemptions. The interest earned, any withdrawal made after the first five years of employment, and maturity returns from the EPF offer tax benefits. Additionally, Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 makes your contribution to the PF tax-deductible. However, the interest earned from the EPF is tax-free only if your yearly contribution is under ₹2.5 lakh. If it is over this amount, you will have to pay a tax on the interest income. You can make withdrawals from the PF in case of any financial or medical emergency before the scheme’s maturity. You can add a family member as your nominee to the PF. If an unfortunate event leads to your absence, the nominees will receive the accumulated PF amount. You also get a life insurance cover under the EPF, ensuring the financial security of your nominees. Employees Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme (EDLI)1976 rules offer this benefit. You can withdraw the money from your PF after two months from the date of resignation if you decide to leave the job. You also have the option to use the Volunteer Provident Fund feature of PF, which allows you to contribute more than 12% if you so wish. Changes in PF interest rates over the years EPFO’s Central Board of Trustees consults with the Ministry of Finance to determine the EPF interest rate every year. Here is a list of the interest rate over the last six financial years. FY Interest Rate 2016-17 8.65% 2017-18 8.55% 2018-19 8.65% 2019-20 8.50% 2020-21 8.50% 2021-22 8.10% 2022-23 8.15% 2023-24 8.25% How to check your EPF account balance online Understanding how PF is calculated is necessary to determine your profits from the scheme.  You can also find the balance online through multiple options, such as: 1. Umang App by the Government of India Follow the below steps to check the EPF balance with the Umang App. Download the app on your smartphone Register on the app with your mobile number Check the EPF balance along with raising and tracking claims 2.  SMS If your Universal Account Number (UAN) is registered with the EPFO, you can find the PF balance and your latest contribution by sending an SMS from your registered phone number.

Beyond calculating the EMI, many calculators also offer additional features like amortisation schedules, which break down the principal and interest components of each EMI over the loan term. This provides a clear picture of how the loan is repaid over time. What is the Federal Bank Home Loan Interest Rate? Federal Bank Home Loans start at 8.80% per year for salaried employees and 10.20% per year for self-employed individuals. However, this rate can change based on your financial situation, the loan amount, how long you want the loan, your credit score, and your overall credit history. To find out the exact interest rate you qualify for, talk to a Federal Bank home loan representative. They can tell you if you're eligible for a loan and what interest rate you'll get on it.

How to Use the Federal Bank Home Loan Interest Rate EMI Calculator? At Jupiter, we’ve developed an easy-to-use Home Loan Interest Rate EMI Calculator to simplify your loan planning. This tool lets you quickly calculate your EMI (Equated Monthly Instalment) for loans from various banks and lenders. Here’s how to use it: 1. Enter Loan Details: Start by scrolling to the top of this page. Input the loan amount you’re considering and the estimated interest rate based on Federal Bank's current offers. 2. Choose Loan Tenure: Select the repayment period (tenure) that suits you. Keep in mind that while a longer tenure may increase your eligibility for a loan, it also means you’ll pay more interest over the life of the loan. 3. Calculate Your EMI: Once you’ve entered all the necessary details, our calculator will automatically provide your estimated monthly EMI. Additionally, our calculator generates an amortisation schedule. This schedule shows how your payments are split between principal and interest, helping you track your repayment progress throughout the loan term. How to Calculate Federal Bank Home Loan EMI? For those who prefer a hands-on approach, you can calculate your EMI using the following formula: Document The EMI calculation is based on a standard mathematical formula: EMI = P × r × (1+ r ) n (1+ r ) n -1 Where: PPP is the principal loan amount r is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12 and then by 100) n is the loan tenure in months (loan tenure in years multiplied by 12) Explanation with an Example
Let’s consider an example to illustrate the calculation: Loan Amount (P): ₹35,00,000 Annual Interest Rate: 8.80% Loan Tenure: 30 years Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 8.80 12 × 100 = 0.007333 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 30 × 12 = 360 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 35,00,000 × 0.007333 × (1+0.007333) 360 ( 1+0.007333 ) 360 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 35,00,000 × 0.007333 × 13.8772 13.8772 - 1 EMI = 356165.5378 12.8772 EMI ≈ ₹27,660 So, the monthly EMI for a loan amount of ₹35,00,000 at an 8.80% annual interest rate over 30 years would be approximately ₹27,660.

An increase in the cost can lead to an overall increase in the price of goods and services. It can also increase our cost of moving around and commuting, thus, messing with our budget. If you struggle with tracking your fuel expenses, a fuel cost calculator can help you. It is a tool that can calculate the fuel cost depending on the distance to be travelled, mileage of your car and the per-unit cost of fuel, both petrol and diesel. Using a calculator for fuel costs can help you anticipate the expenses on fuel and take necessary action to keep your budget on track. The formula for fuel cost calculation A fuel cost calculator help calculate estimated costs based on certain inputs, including, Trip Distance (in km) Fuel Efficiency (in km/litre) Fuel Price (in Rs/litre) Once you have all this data, you can input them into the fuel cost calculator. Here is the formula: Fuel cost=(Trip Distance/mileage)X per unit price of Fuel How to estimate fuel costs? Jupiter’s fuel cost calculator can help you estimate your annual expense on fuel in advance. For this, you will need to provide the following inputs to the calculator: Your monthly income Your Daily movement in car Fuel Price Mileage of your vehicle To get the right output from the Petrol cost calculator , you should know the accurate mileage of your vehicle. Suppose you do not know the mileage of your vehicle. In that case, you can calculate it by using the trip metre after filling the tank to full capacity and measuring the distance run at the next refill and the formula of the Fuel Mileage Calculator. For example, Ramesh fills his Honda City car with a tank capacity of 45 litres in full and sets the trip metre to 0. One week later, he asks the pump operator to fill his tank again and realises that the tank will take 30 litres of petrol. The trip metre shows a reading of 510 km, which means the car has run a distance of 510 km in one week and consumed 30 litres of petrol. Thus, the mileage of the car is 510/30 = 17 km/l. So, if Ramesh has to plan his next trip of 340 Km and the cost of the petrol is Rs. 120/litre, he can estimate the cost using the fuel cost calculator as (340/17) *120= 2400 INR, so he will keep aside a provision of Rs.2400 for the cost of fuel during the trip. Factors driving fuel prices Petrol and diesel are the products of crude oil. So, the price of fuel will depend on the price of crude oil that is decided internationally. Some factors that may impact petrol and diesel price include Supply and demand: The supply of petrol depends on a handful of oil-producing countries in the Middle East and other countries like Russia, Brazil, and Venezuela. These countries control the price by limiting supply through a cartel. Any geopolitical tension amongst these countries, like the current Russia-Ukraine war, pulls the price of the crude up; thus, the price of petrol and diesel also rises. Price charged to dealers: The price charged by the Oil Marketing Companies to their dealers is an important determinant of the oil prices. Commission structure: Commission paid by the Oil Marketing Companies to the dealers determines the price at which the petrol or diesel is available to the end consumer. Central Excise duty:  Excise duty levied by the central government on petrol and diesel form a significant part of their price. Taxes: Additional taxes are levied by state governments that add to the fuel price. Demand for Fuel: A higher demand for fuel in comparison to supply will push the prices up. With an increase in the number of vehicles these days, the demand is at an all-time high. Consumption ratio of refineries:  If the number of refineries is less, or they are operating at less efficiency, they will not be able to fulfil the demand and push the prices. US-INR rate: Since India has to pay its oil import bill in US dollars, an increase in the price of USD vis-à-vis INR will make the oil costly and vice versa. GST and Fuel Prices In India, the prices of petrol and diesel do not come under the ambit of GST. The central and state governments impose excise duty and value-added tax on petrol and diesel prices. In fact, if petrol and diesel are brought under the ambit of GST, they will become cheaper for the consumers than the current levels, even if they are placed in the highest slab of the GST, i.e., 28%. There has been demand from certain sections to bring petrol and diesel under GST, but that would mean a loss of a big chunk of revenue, both for central and state governments. Fuel Prices in various Indian Cities Since the taxes and charges levied by different state governments on petrol and diesel prices are different, the prices of petrol and diesel vary widely across the states. Here is a table comparing fuel prices across the major cities in India. S.No City Petrol Price Diesel Price 1 New Delhi 105.41 96.67 2 Mumbai 120.51 104.77 3 Chennai 110.85 100.94 4 Kolkata 115.12 99.83 5 Hyderabad 119.47 105.47 6 Bengaluru 111.09 94.79 7 Lucknow 105.25 96.81 8 Jaipur 118.01 100.91 5 effective ways of achieving fuel economy Fuel is a limited resource. Since it has a high cost, you should do your best to save fuel wherever possible. Here are some things you can do to save fuel: Drive Efficiently: Good driving practices go a long way in saving fuel. Regularly check the tire pressures in all the tires, switch off the engine when you are waiting at the signal and follow the speed limits, as unnecessary speeding will result in high fuel consumption. Pay online and use rewards programs: Some credit card companies offer cashback and discounts on purchasing fuel. Understand and utilise this facility from your banking service provider Keep your vehicle light: An Increase in weight can lead to low fuel efficiency for the car. So, avoid piling up unnecessary items in your vehicle and ease its load for maximum fuel efficiency. Do carpool: Carpooling while going to the office or sending your kids to school can be an efficient way to save fuel. Timely Servicing and maintenance of the vehicle go a long way in keeping the mileage of the vehicle optimum, thus saving fuel. FAQs How do I use the fuel cost calculator ? To calculate your annual cost of fuel, you need to know the following: The distance you travel daily in your car. The mileage of your vehicle. The cost of Diesel/Petrol per litre. Your Monthly income. The fuel cost calculator will calculate your annual fuel cost or fuel cost per trip based on these inputs. 2.  What will my trip cost? To calculate the cost of your trip, you need to input the trip distance, mileage of your car and the cost of fuel in the fuel calculator. The calculator will then give you the expected fuel cost of your trip. 3.  How do I calculate the distance that I can cover for a certain price? To calculate the distance that you can cover on a particular trip, you will need to enter the targeted expense amount and the mileage of the car. Once you enter these details, the fuel calculator will tell you how many kilometres you can travel on a particular trip. 4.  How much fuel (Petrol/Diesel) will I need for a particular trip? To estimate this, you will need to input the total distance of the trip that you expect and the mileage of the vehicle into the fuel consumption calculator. This will give you the amount of fuel required to complete the trip. In this article Calculators Similar articles that might interest you!

Gratuity is the amount that employers pay their employees in return for the services rendered by them to the organization. However, it is paid only to those employees who have completed at least five years of service for a particular company. However, an employee is eligible for gratuity before completing at least five years of services if he or she is disabled due to an ailment or an accidental injury. This employee benefit is regulated by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The amount depends on the employee’s last drawn monthly salary and the number of years completed working with the particular company. The gratuity may also be paid in case of an employee’s demise before the end of five years. Our gratuity calculator can help you estimate your gratuity value. Eligibility Criteria for Gratuity Gratuity is a lump sum paid by your employer when you leave the company after having worked for at least five years. The eligibility criteria as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 are as follows: You should have rendered your services to the same company for a minimum of five consecutive years. You must be eligible for superannuation. You should have either retired or resigned after at least five years of working with the same employer. The benefits are given to you in case of your disability due to an accident or a medical condition; your nominee receives the benefit in case of your demise. What Is Gratuity Calculator? Private sector employees working for companies offering Employee Provident Fund (EPF) benefits receive gratuity after rendering services for at least five consecutive years. However, in some cases (employee’s disablement or demise), gratuity can be paid before five years. An online gratuity calculator enables you to estimate the amount you may receive if you are considering leaving the organization after working for a minimum of five years or are retiring. The gratuity calculator is a handy tool to calculate the amount you will receive on leaving the company. How to Calculate Gratuity? The gratuity amount primarily depends on two factors, which include your last drawn salary (basic + dearness allowance) and the total number of years in service for the company. The law does not stipulate any specific percentage for employees to receive this benefit at the time of leaving or retiring from the company. Employers can adopt a formula-based approach to determine the amount or pay higher than this amount. What Is Gratuity Formula? The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 classifies employees in two categories, which include the following. Personnel covered under the Act Employees not covered under the Act Any company that employs 10 or more employees in one month for the last 12 months is required to cover all its personnel under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. If the number of employees reduces below 10, the company is still liable to pay gratuity to the remaining personnel. The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 covers people employed in mines, factories, plantations, ports, and companies employing more than 10 people. Unlike Provident Fund , the employees do not contribute towards gratuity and the entire amount is paid by the companies. Employers can opt for a group gratuity plan from a reliable insurance service provider wherein the company makes annual contributions to this plan. The gratuity formula varies on whether you are covered or not covered by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The gratuity formula included in the gratuity calculator for covered employees is Gratuity Amount = last drawn salary * employment duration * 15/26 The number of working days in a month is considered 26 The gratuity amount calculation is based on the earnings for 15 days The last drawn salary should include the basic income, dearness allowance (DA) (for government employees), and sales commissions (if any) If you have completed 11 years in your company and your last drawn salary including DA is INR 65,000, the gratuity amount is Amount = 65,000 * 11 * 15/26 = INR 4,12,500 If you are not covered by the act, here is how to calculate gratuity amount: Amount = last drawn salary * employment duration * 15/30 In the example above, the gratuity amount comes to INR 3,57,500 How Can Gratuity Calculator Help You? If you have worked for the same company for at least five years and are near the age of superannuation, you are eligible to receive gratuity. An online gratuity calculator can help you in the following ways. Determine the approximate amount due Plan your long-term finances Save your time and reduce your efforts Use it from any place any time as per your convenience How to use Jupiter's Gratuity Calculator? Jupiter's gratuity calculator can be used by following these simple steps. Keep all important details about your employment record ready. Enter your Basic Monthly Salary including Dearness Allowance and the gratuity value will be calculated within seconds. What Are the Benefits of Using Gratuity Calculator? A gratuity calculator online is an efficient and user-friendly tool that allows you to estimate the approximate amount due to you. Here are some benefits of this gratuity calculator. Quick and simple calculation with instant results. Simple details like salary and number of years in employment required. Elimination of human errors in the case of manual calculations. Shows the gratuity amounts for both covered and uncovered calculations. What Are the Tax Rules for Gratuity? The tax applicability on the gratuity amount depends on the type of organization. If you are a government employee, the entire amount is exempt from taxes. If you work for a private sector company, the lowest amount from the following is tax-free only if your employer is covered under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Eligible gratuity amount INR 20 lakhs The actual gratuity amount received The maximum amount of gratuity you can claim as tax-exempt cannot exceed INR 20 lakhs during your entire working life. For instance, INR 4,12,500 is the gratuity amount you're eligible for, according to the earlier example. Your employer had already paid INR 10 lakh. The government has set a maximum limit of INR 20 lakh that can be tax-free. Out of the three figures,  INR 4,12,500 is the lowest which is exempt from tax.

Let’s consider an example to illustrate the calculation: Loan Amount (P): ₹60,00,000 Annual Interest Rate: 8.75% Loan Tenure: 25 years Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 8.75 12 × 100 = 0.007291 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 25 × 12 = 300 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 60,00,000 × 0.007291 × (1+0.007291) 300 ( 1+0.007291 ) 300 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 60,00,000 × 0.007291 × 8.8406 8.8406 - 1 EMI = 386740.8876 7.8406 EMI ≈ ₹49,329 So, the monthly EMI for a loan amount of ₹60,00,000 at an 8.75% annual interest rate over 20 years would be approximately ₹49,329.

How to Apply for HDFC Home Loan The process of applying for a home loan with HDFC Bank can be broken down into a few simple steps. Here's a breakdown of what you can expect: 1. Filling the Application Form The first step is to complete a loan application form. This form will ask for basic information like your name, address, contact details, education, and employment type (salaried or self-employed). You'll also need to provide details about your income. 2. Submitting Documents Once you've filled out the form, you'll need to submit some documents to verify your information. These documents typically include: Proof of identity (PAN card, Aadhar card, Voter ID, or Driving license) Proof of address (utility bills) Recent salary slips (3 months for salaried individuals) Proof of employment Bank statements for the last 6 months Form 16 (for salaried individuals) Self-employed applicants will need to provide additional documents, such as income tax returns for the past 2 years and other income proofs. 3. Processing and Verification After submitting your application and documents, the bank will begin processing your request. This includes verifying all the information you provided. A bank representative may contact your workplace or residence for verification purposes. The bank will also check your credit score to assess your creditworthiness as a borrower. Maintaining a good credit history is important for a smooth application process. 4. Loan Sanction Letter If everything looks good, the bank will send you a sanction letter if your application is approved. This letter serves as confirmation that the bank has agreed to your loan request. The letter will detail important information about the loan, such as: The approved loan amount The offered interest rate (fixed or variable) Loan repayment period Repayment terms and conditions Carefully review the sanction letter before signing and returning it to the bank. The loan process cannot move forward until the bank receives your signed copy. 5. Secure Payment Fee After you approve the loan agreement, there's a one-time fee called a secure payment fee. The bank might ask for this fee upfront, either before or after your loan is approved. 6. Legal and Technical Checks Before disbursing the loan amount, the bank will conduct legal and technical checks on the property you're applying the loan for. This ensures clear ownership rights and verifies the information provided. The bank will also evaluate the property's value, considering factors like its status (under construction or resale), construction stage (if applicable), age, and maintenance condition. They will also check for any previous mortgages on the property (in case of resale). 7. Loan Disbursal Upon successful completion of these checks, the bank will grant final approval for your home loan. You'll receive a final agreement letter and, once the loan is disbursed, a welcome kit and a detailed schedule outlining your monthly loan payments (EMIs). Eligibility Criteria for HDFC Home Loan General Requirements: Age: 21 to 65 years (both salaried and self-employed) Maximum Loan Term: 30 years Positive credit history with a credit score of 750 or above Existing financial obligations will be considered (e.g., car loans, credit card debt) Additional Requirements: Salaried Individuals: Minimum monthly salary of ₹10,000 and minimum employment of 2 years.

Frequently Asked Questions Q1: Can I switch from a floating rate of interest to a fixed rate of interest in my HDFC Home Loan? A: HDFC may offer balance transfer options to switch from a floating to a fixed interest rate. Contact HDFC to discuss your specific loan and eligibility for such programs. Q2: What is the Loan-To-Value (LTV) ratio for HDFC home loans? A: The LTV depends on the loan amount. Generally, it's: 90% for loans less than Rs. 30 lakhs. 80% for loans between Rs. 30 lakhs and Rs. 75 lakhs. 75% for loans above Rs. 75 lakhs. Q3: When do EMI repayments for HDFC home loans begin? A: EMI repayments typically start one month after the loan is disbursed. Q4: What factors determine the tenure of my HDFC home loan? A: Your age, income, loan amount, creditworthiness, and desired EMI amount all influence the maximum loan tenure offered by HDFC. Q5: What is the maximum tenure for an HDFC home loan? A: The maximum tenure for HDFC home loans generally ranges from 15 to 30 years, depending on your eligibility. Q6: Is the HDFC Home Loan Calculator accurate? A: The HDFC Home Loan Calculator provides an estimate. Actual interest rates and EMIs may vary based on your specific profile and final loan approval terms. Q7: How can I reduce my EMI for my HDFC Bank Home Loan? A: Consider increasing your down payment to lower the loan amount. You can also explore extending the loan tenure (if eligible) to bring down the monthly EMI. Q8: Can I add family members as co-guarantors for my HDFC Home Loan? A: Yes, including a co-applicant with strong creditworthiness can improve your eligibility or potentially allow for a better interest rate. However, it's best to contact HDFC directly for personalised guidance on your loan and situation. Q9: What is the meaning of 'Own Contribution' in HDFC Home Loan? A: Own contribution is the down payment you make upfront, which is a percentage of the property value. HDFC offers home loans up to a certain LTV, so you'll need to cover the remaining cost with your own contribution. Q10: When does repayment of the principal amount for HDFC Bank Home Loan begin? A: Your EMI payments go towards both the principal amount (loan itself) and the interest. The principal amount reduces with each EMI payment over the loan tenure. Q11: What is the 30% EMI rule? A: This is a general guideline suggesting your total EMI obligations (including your home loan EMI) shouldn't exceed 30% of your gross monthly income. Q12: Can we prepay more than the EMI amount on a HDFC Bank Home Loan? A: Yes, HDFC typically allows you to make full or partial prepayments on your home loan, which can help you save on interest and pay off the loan faster.

This home loan prepayment calculator acts as your personal loan advisor, helping you estimate the exact amount you'll need to pay each month (EMI) to repay your home loan. By using this calculator, you can: Plan Your Budget: Get a clear picture of how much you can afford to borrow based on your financial situation. Compare Loan Offers: Evaluate different loan options by comparing interest rates and EMIs from various lenders. Visualize Long-Term Costs: Understand the total repayment amount over the loan tenure, including both principal and interest, to make better financial decisions. How to Use a Home Loan Calculator? Step-by-Step Guide Using a home loan EMI calculator is easy and can help you get a quick estimate of your monthly loan payments. Here's how it works: Enter Loan Amount: Start by entering the total sum of money you plan to borrow for your home loan. This is known as the principal loan amount. Enter Interest Rate: Next, input the annual interest rate offered by your lender. This rate is typically a percentage. Be sure to confirm if it's a fixed or adjustable rate. Enter Loan Tenure: Input the timeframe for repaying the loan, usually specified in years. The chosen tenure significantly impacts your monthly EMI. Longer tenures result in lower EMIs, while shorter tenures lead to higher EMIs. Add Pre-Payment Amount (if applicable): Now, enter the amount you wish to pre-pay, if any, and related information or skip this step. Add Processing Fee Amount (if applicable): Next, enter the processing fee amount. Calculate Your EMI: Once you've entered all the details, the home loan emi prepayment calculator will process this information and quickly generate your EMI payment table or amortisation schedule. Review Your Results: The EMI calculator amortisation table provides insights into several key aspects: Monthly EMI: This is the fixed amount you'll pay each month. Principal Amount: This shows the total principal amount you'll pay over the entire loan tenure. Total Interest Payable: This shows the total interest you'll pay over the entire loan tenure. Pre-payment: This is the amount you have chosen to pay ahead and have entered into the calculator. Total Payment (Principal + Interest + Pre-payment): This is the sum of the principal loan amount, the total interest payable and your pre-payment amount. Loan Paid to Date: This reflects the loan you have paid and can help you figure out your outstanding loan balance after each EMI payment, allowing you to track the remaining loan amount over time. Common Home Loan EMI values: Note: We have considered the interest rate at 8.75% for the home loan EMI calculations. Use this for informational purposes only.

EMIs are calculated using a formula that considers three key factors: 1. Principal Loan Amount (P): The total amount you borrow from the lender. 2. Interest Rate (R): The annual interest rate charged by the lender on the loan amount. 3. Loan Tenure (N): The total duration (in years) for which you repay the loan. The EMI calculation is based on a standard mathematical formula: EMI = [P x R x (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N - 1] Document The EMI calculation is based on a standard mathematical formula: EMI = P × r × (1+ r ) n (1+ r ) n -1 Where: PPP is the principal loan amount r is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12 and then by 100) n is the loan tenure in months (loan tenure in years multiplied by 12) Explanation with an Example
Let’s consider an example to illustrate the calculation: Loan Amount (P): ₹30,00,000 Annual Interest Rate: 8% Loan Tenure: 20 years Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 8 12 × 100 = 0.00667 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 20 × 12 = 240 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 30,00,000 × 0.00667 × (1+0.00667) 240 ( 1+0.00667 ) 240 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 30,00,000 × 0.00667 × 4.9307 4.9307 - 1 EMI = 98663.307 3.9307 EMI ≈ ₹25,100 So, the monthly EMI for a loan amount of ₹30,00,000 at an 8% annual interest rate over 20 years would be approximately ₹25,100. Benefits of Using a Prepayment Calculator for Home Loan Quick and Convenient: Using a home loan EMI calculator is straightforward. Just enter some basic details, and you'll get your results in seconds. Plus, it's completely free and doesn't require any registration. Accurate Estimates: Get reliable results without any manual calculation errors. Compares Loan Offers: Easily compare different loan options side-by-side to find the best fit for your needs.

Plan Your Tenure: The calculator can help you choose a loan term that aligns with your financial situation. Home Loan EMIs Payment Options Online Transfers with Net Banking: Pay your EMI through online platforms from your computer or phone using your bank's mobile app. Ensure a secure internet connection and follow your bank's instructions for security. Unified Payments Interface (UPI): Connect your bank account to a UPI app and make payments quickly and easily. UPI offers instant and secure transfers. In-Person Payments at the Bank: Visit your bank branch to make your payment over the counter. This allows you to speak with a bank representative if you have any questions. ECS (Electronic Clearing Service): Authorise your bank to automatically deduct the EMI amount from your account on the due date, eliminating the need for paper checks or visiting a branch. Mobile Wallets: Use mobile wallet apps to manage your EMI payments. These apps offer features like transaction history, alerts, and reminders. Cheque Payments: Submit a cheque for your EMI payment at the bank branch. Cheques provide a physical record of payment but can be slower due to processing times. Electronic Standing Instruction (e-Mandate): Set up automated payments through e-Mandate for recurring payments. It combines the ease of automatic deductions with the speed of online platforms. National Automated Clearing House (NACH): Similar to ECS, NACH handles large numbers of transactions electronically. Authorise your bank to automatically deduct your EMI payment. Charges Applicable on Non-payment of Home Loan EMIs Late Payment Penalties and Fees: Missing an EMI payment can result in late fees, interest on the overdue amount, and other penalties depending on your lender's policies. Typically, late fees range from 1% to 2% of the EMI amount due. NACH/SI/Cheque Bounce Charges: These charges apply when a home loan payment fails due to insufficient funds in the linked account or if the account is closed. Negative Impact on Credit Score: Making on-time payments helps build a good credit score. Missing a payment can lower your credit score significantly and affect the credit score of someone who co-signed your loan application. Can Affect Transfer Eligibility: Missed payments can make it harder to qualify for a balance transfer to a new lender with a lower interest rate. Non-Performing Asset (NPA) Status: If you miss your first two loan payments, your lender will send reminders. If you haven't made a payment in 90 days, your loan may be classified as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA). Increased Costs for Subsequent EMI Payments: Missing a home loan EMI can result in increased future payments due to added late fees and penalties. What Factors Affect Your Home Loan EMI? Loan Amount (Principal): The total sum you borrow for your home purchase. A larger loan amount translates to a higher EMI payment. Interest Rate: The interest rate offered by the bank determines how much you pay in addition to the loan amount. A higher interest rate translates to a higher EMI. Processing Fee: The processing fee covers the cost of reviewing your home loan application. It's usually a percentage of the loan amount or set as a fixed fee. Loan Tenure: Longer loan tenures result in lower monthly EMIs but higher total interest paid over time. Shorter tenures lead to higher monthly EMIs but lower total interest. Prepayments: Making extra payments towards your home loan can significantly impact your EMIs. These prepayments reduce the outstanding principal amount, leading to lower EMIs. What are Flexible and Fixed Home Loan EMIs? While most home loan EMIs are fixed throughout the loan term, they might change in some situations: Flexible Home Loan EMIs: Step-up loans gradually increase your EMI amount over the loan term, while step-down loans see a decrease in EMI as time goes on. Partly Disbursed Loan: You may encounter pre-EMIs initially if your loan is disbursed in stages. Impact of Rising Floating Interest Rates: If the repo rate changes, it can affect your floating interest rate. If the interest rate goes up, your lender might extend your loan term or increase your EMI. Home Loan Prepayment: Making additional payments towards your home loan principal can affect your EMIs. You can lower your EMI amount or shorten the loan term. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a home loan amortisation schedule?

If you’re thinking of planning out home loan payments, the HSBC Bank Home Loan EMI Calculator is your tool. It’ll instantly show your monthly payment, just type in the loan amount you’re thinking of, the interest rate, and how long you want to repay it. A good way to see if a loan matches your budget, and plan ahead without any guesswork. What is the HSBC Bank Home Loan Interest Rate? HSBC currently offers home loan rates from 8.50% to 10.00%; rates vary by factors like how long to borrow for, your credit score and the market you’re in at the time. Types of HSBC Bank Home Loan HSBC offers a few different types of home loans, each designed for different needs: Home Loan : This is your standard loan for buying a property. It comes with competitive interest rates and flexible repayment options, making it a solid choice for first-time homebuyers. Smart Home : Think of this as a more flexible home loan. It works like an overdraft, letting you withdraw, repay, and reduce your interest as you go. It's great if you want a bit more freedom with your finances. Loan Against Property : If you do have some, you can take a loan against your property. If you’re in need of funds for big expenses, business ventures or renovations, this is your best option. Smart Loan Against Property : Just like a regular loan against property, but with a little more freedom. This comes with the overdraft feature to help you handle your loan repayments a bit more fluidly. NRI Home Loans : If you’re living abroad but want to buy a property back in India, this loan is tailored for non-resident Indians (NRIs). It offers the convenience of making repayments from overseas. NRI Loan Against Property (LAP) : If you’re an NRI already owning property in India, this loan will allow you to tap into that asset for financial needs. It’s perfect for when you need a lump sum for business or personal use. Sustainable Mortgages : If you are interested in buying an eco-friendly home, this loan offers better terms for green properties, which can save you money in the long run. Since a loan has its perks, it’s not always the same loan that’s best for you- it all depends on what you want, such as flexibility, sustainability or using an existing property for funding. Key Features of HSBC Bank Home Loans Here are the HSBC’s Home Loan features, broken down in simple terms: Balance Transfer : If you’re stuck with a home loan from another bank, HSBC lets you move it over to them at a lower interest rate, allowing you to save on interest and pay off your loan quicker. No Prepayment Charges : Your loan comes with a floating interest rate? No worries! You don’t have to pay any extra if you want to pay off your loan early with HSBC. As such, if you come into some extra money or want to pay off your debt faster, you’re not going to be impeded by fees or penalties. Loan Amount : Whether you need a small loan or a big loan for your mansion, HSBC provides loan ranging from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 30 crores. They’ve got you covered no matter which budget you have. Loan Tenure : You are also provided flexibility with your repayment. You can stretch your loan tenure up to 25 years, making those monthly payments a bit easier to handle. In short, they make the whole home loan process quite simple, with a lot of options to fit your needs. How to Use the HSBC Bank Home Loan EMI Calculator Here’s how you can use the HSBC Bank Home Loan EMI Calculator in the easiest way possible: Go to the top of the page where you’ll find the HSBC Home Loan EMI Calculator. Enter the amount you want to borrow. This is your loan amount. Next, enter the interest rate for your home loan. This is usually provided by the bank, so just type that in. Pick the loan tenure (how long you want to repay the loan). The longer the tenure, the smaller your EMI, but you’ll end up paying more interest over time. If you’re going to pay some extra money towards your loan earlier than planned, add that amount here. This can help reduce your EMI or the total loan term. Sometimes banks charge a processing fee. If you know how much it is, enter it here so it’s included in your calculation. After entering all your details, just hit the ‘Calculate’ button. The calculator will do its magic and show you how much you need to pay every month. The calculator will show: Monthly EMI: This is how much you’ll pay every month. Principal Amount: The amount you’ve borrowed. Total Interest Payable: How much interest you’ll pay over the life of the loan. Pre-payment: If you’ve added extra payments, it’ll show how it affects the total loan. Total Payment (Principal + Interest + Pre-payment): This is how much you’ll pay in total, including the principal, interest, and any pre-payments. Loan Paid to Date: If you’ve already made some payments, it will show how much you’ve paid off so far. And that’s it! You’ll now have a clear picture of your monthly payments and the full cost of your home loan. How to Calculate HSBC Bank Home Loan EMI? For those who prefer a hands-on approach, you can calculate your EMI using the following formula: Document The EMI calculation is based on a standard mathematical formula: EMI = P × r × (1+ r ) n (1+ r ) n -1 Where: PPP is the principal loan amount r is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12 and then by 100) n is the loan tenure in months (loan tenure in years multiplied by 12) Explanation with an Example
Let’s consider an example to illustrate the calculation: Loan Amount (P): ₹25,00,000 Annual Interest Rate: 8.50% Loan Tenure: 25 years Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 8.5 12 × 100 = 0.0070 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 25 × 12 = 300 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 25,00,000 × 0.0070 × (1+0.0070) 300 ( 1+0.0070 ) 300 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 25,00,000 × 0.0070 × 8.1066 8.1066 - 1 EMI = 1,41,865.5 7.1066 EMI ≈ ₹20,131 So, the monthly EMI for a loan amount of ₹25,00,000 at an 8.50% annual interest rate over 25 years would be approximately ₹20,131.

How to Calculate ICICI Home Loan EMI?

Let’s consider an example to illustrate the calculation: Loan Amount (P): ₹80,00,000 Annual Interest Rate: 9.60% Loan Tenure: 30 years Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 9.6 12 × 100 = 0.008 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 30 × 12 = 360 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 80,00,000 × 0.008 × (1+0.008) 360 ( 1+0.008 ) 360 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 80,00,000 × 0.008 × 17.6113 17.6113 - 1 EMI = 1127123.2 16.7113 EMI ≈ ₹67,852 So, the monthly EMI for a loan amount of ₹80,00,000 at an 9.60% annual interest rate over 30 years would be approximately ₹67,852.

How to Manually Calculate IDFC Home Loan EMI? For those who prefer a hands-on approach, you can calculate your EMI using the following formula: Document The EMI calculation is based on a standard mathematical formula: EMI = P × r × (1+ r ) n (1+ r ) n -1 Where: PPP is the principal loan amount r is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12 and then by 100) n is the loan tenure in months (loan tenure in years multiplied by 12) Explanation with an Example
Let’s consider an example to illustrate the calculation: Loan Amount (P): ₹50,00,000 Annual Interest Rate: 8.85% Loan Tenure: 30 years Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 8.85 12 × 100 = 0.007375 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 30 × 12 = 360 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 35,00,000 × 0.007375 × (1+0.007375) 360 ( 1+0.007375 ) 360 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 50,00,000 × 0.007375 × 14.0870 14.0870 - 1 EMI = 519458.125 13.0870 EMI ≈ ₹39,693 So, the monthly EMI for a loan amount of ₹50,00,000 at an 8.85% annual interest rate over 30 years would be approximately ₹39,693.

Age: The applicant must be between 18 and 75 years old. Occupation: Both paid and self-employed individuals are welcome to apply. It is critical to establish your eligibility first to avoid unnecessary disappointments during the application process. FAQs Can you get a home loan with a co-applicant, i.e. jointly? Yes, a home loan can be obtained with a co-applicant. This may boost your borrowing capability. Suppose both applicants have a consistent income and a solid credit rating. In that case, they may be eligible for reduced interest rates and better terms. What is the processing charge for a home loan? The processing charge ranges typically between 0.5% and 2% of the loan amount, depending on the lender. It's a one-time fee to confirm your application and creditworthiness. When does the payback period on a home loan begin? The payback period typically begins after the loan has been disbursed. However, some lenders may provide a grace period during which you only have to pay interest (also known as pre-EMI) before the full EMI kicks in. Who can be a co-applicant for my home loan? Co-applicants may be family members, such as spouses, siblings, or parents. Some lenders accept friends or business partners but verify with your lender for specific rules. Can I get a tax break on a home loan? Absolutely! Many countries allow homeowners to deduct the interest paid on their house loans. The tax benefits vary by location. Therefore, you should consult a tax specialist about your specific circumstances. What documents are needed for a home loan? A typical home loan document includes: Identity evidence (e.g., Aadhar card or passport) Address proof (such as utility bills) Income proof (such as salary slips and tax returns) Property documents How does my credit score impact home loan approval? Your credit score is an essential aspect in evaluating whether you qualify for a home loan. A higher score usually means better interest rates and terms. Most lenders consider a credit score higher than 750 to be good. What is the pre-EMI interest rate on a home loan? Pre-EMI interest is interest paid during the construction phase of a property. This means you can make loan instalments before the whole EMI is due, which is usually useful if the property isn't ready right away. Does the IIFL house loan EMI calculator take into account prepayments or partial payments? Yes, the IIFL home loan EMI calculator often accepts prepayments or partial payments. What happens if interest rates rise in the future after I obtain a house loan from IIFL Bank? For individuals with fixed-rate mortgages, the rate remains unchanged. However, with ARMs, the interest rate might rise, thus raising your monthly payments. Always read the terms thoroughly. Can NRIs apply for IIFL bank home loans? Yes, non-resident Indians (NRIs) can apply for home loans at IIFL Bank. They must present particular papers, such as evidence of income and identity from their country of residence. What factors affect the interest rates on IIFL bank home loans? Factors that can influence your interest rate are: Your credit score Income stability Loan amount and loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Market circumstances. Are there any prepayment penalties for IIFL bank home loans? Many lenders offer prepayments without penalty, but policies differ, so verify before signing the contract. Can I transfer my existing home loan to IIFL bank? Yes, loan transfers are generally available, and they can result in cheaper interest rates or better conditions. However, you should consider the fees connected with such a move to ensure that it is worthwhile. In this article Calculators Similar articles that might interest you!

An EMI calculator is a fantastic tool offered by Indian Bank, and other lenders like Jupiter, to provide instant estimates of your monthly payment based on your loan amount, interest rate, and chosen tenure. However, if you prefer a more hands-on approach you can calculate your EMI manually using a simple formula. The formula used to calculate your EMI involves three key factors: Document The EMI calculation is based on a standard mathematical formula: EMI = P × r × (1+ r ) n (1+ r ) n -1 Where: PPP is the principal loan amount r is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12 and then by 100) n is the loan tenure in months (loan tenure in years multiplied by 12) Explanation with an Example
Let’s consider an example to illustrate the calculation: Loan Amount (P): ₹20,00,000 Annual Interest Rate: 8.40% Loan Tenure: 20 years Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 8.40 12 × 100 = 0.007 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 20 × 12 = 240 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 20,00,000 × 0.007 × (1+0.007) 240 ( 1+0.007 ) 240 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 20,00,000 × 0.007 × 5.3342 5.3342 - 1 EMI = 74678.8 4.3342 EMI ≈ ₹17,230 So, the monthly EMI for a loan amount of ₹20,00,000 at an 8.40% annual interest rate over 20 years would be approximately ₹17,230.

Review your results in terms of the following factors: Monthly EMI Principal Amount Total Interest Payable Pre-payment Total Payment: (Principal + Interest + Prepayment) How Do You Calculate IOB Bank Home Loan EMI? For those who prefer a hands-on approach, you can calculate your EMI using the following: Document The EMI calculation is based on a standard mathematical formula: EMI = P × r × (1+ r ) n (1+ r ) n -1 Where: PPP is the principal loan amount r is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12 and then by 100) n is the loan tenure in months (loan tenure in years multiplied by 12) Explanation with an Example
Let’s consider an example to illustrate the calculation: Loan Amount (P): ₹30,00,000 Annual Interest Rate: 8.4% Loan Tenure: 25 years Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 8.40 12 × 100 = 0.007 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 25 × 12 = 300 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 30,00,000 × 0.007 × (1+0.007) <5sup>300 ( 1+0.007 ) 300 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 30,00,000 × 0.007 × 8.106645 8.106645 - 1 EMI = 1,70,239.545 7.106645 EMI ≈ ₹23,995 So, the monthly EMI for a loan amount of ₹30,00,000 at an 8.40% annual interest rate over 25 years would be approximately ₹23,955 Benefits of Using the IOB Home Loan EMI Calculator Using the IOB's EMI calculator has numerous benefits, including: Quick and Accurate Calculations: The online calculator performs precise calculations in seconds.

One of the first questions you may have when considering a house loan is the length of the repayment period. For Indian Overseas Bank, the maximum home loan tenure usually is 30 years. This extended repayment time enables you to spread out your payments, making monthly instalments (EMIs) more bearable. Can family members join as co-guarantors? Yes, you can add family members as co-guarantors to your Indian Overseas Bank house loan. Adding a co-borrower can help your application, especially if they have good credit and a steady income. What happens if EMI payments aren't made on time? The timely payment of your EMIs is crucial. Suppose you fail to make a payment on time. In that case, IOB may incur a default fee, which is usually a percentage of the outstanding EMI.

Can I insert different loan amounts into the Indian Overseas Bank home loan EMI calculator? Absolutely.

It is important to note that the actual interest rate may vary depending on a number of factors, including your credit score, income, and loan amount. Can I prepay my Indian Overseas Bank home loan EMI? Yes, IOB provides for the prepayment of house loans without penalty, which is an appealing feature. Prepaying a portion of your loan can assist you in minimising the principal amount owed or the overall interest burden. What if I miss an EMI payment? Missing an EMI payment has ramifications for your credit history and general financial health. The first consequence is penal interest, which means that IOB may charge you additional costs for missed payments. Can I select between fixed and fluctuating rates? Absolutely! When you apply for a home loan with Indian Overseas Bank, you can choose between fixed and fluctuating interest rate schemes. What is the vacation period for Indian Overseas Bank's home loans? The holiday period, also known as the moratorium, is a grace period granted by IOB during which debtors are not required to make EMI payments for a defined length of time. Typically, this takes 3 to 6 months after receiving a home loan. What is the minimum credit score required to obtain an Indian Overseas Home Loan? Before applying for an IOB house loan, make sure you have a minimum credit score of 650. However, a score of at least 750 is frequently considered excellent and can increase your chances of obtaining favourable loan rates. What is the processing fee for an IOB housing loan? The processing charge for house loans is generally between 0.5% and 1% of the loan amount. This fee is collected for processing your application and varies depending on the loan amount and other criteria. In this article Calculators Similar articles that might interest you!

Let’s consider an example to illustrate the calculation: Loan Amount (P): ₹25,00,000 Annual Interest Rate: 8.75% Loan Tenure: 30 years Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 8.75 12 × 100 = 0.007291 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 30 × 12 = 360 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 25,00,000 × 0.007291 × (1+0.007291) <5sup>360 ( 1+0.007291 ) 360 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 25,00,000 × 0.007291 × 12.670465 12.670465 - 1 EMI = 2,49,178.4007875 11.670465 EMI ≈ ₹19,668 So, the monthly EMI for a loan amount of ₹25,00,000 at an 8.75% annual interest rate over 30 years would be approximately ₹19,668.

Imagine taking that first step towards your dream home. You've explored properties, crunched some numbers, and now it's time to delve into the specifics of financing. This is where the Kotak Home Loan EMI Calculator comes in. At its core, the Kotak Home Loan EMI Calculator is an online tool that helps you estimate the Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI) you'd pay on a Kotak Mahindra Bank home loan. It simplifies the process of understanding how much your monthly repayments would be based on various factors. The calculator typically asks for three important inputs: 1. Loan Amount: This is the total sum of money you'd be borrowing from the bank to finance your home purchase. 2. Interest Rate: This is the rate of interest charged by Kotak Mahindra Bank on your home loan. It's a crucial factor influencing your EMI amount. 3. Loan Tenure: This refers to the total duration for which you'd be repaying the loan, along with the interest. Once you input these values, the calculator performs a quick calculation and provides an EMI figure. This figure represents the combined principal and interest amount you'd pay towards your home loan every month. It's important to remember that the EMI figure generated by the calculator is an estimate. The actual EMI offered by Kotak Mahindra Bank might differ slightly based on various factors like processing fees, specific loan schemes, and your creditworthiness. However, the calculator serves as a valuable starting point to get a clear understanding of your potential monthly repayments for a Kotak Home Loan. What is the Kotak Home Loan Interest Rate? Kotak Mahindra Bank offers competitive home loan interest rates starting at 8.70% for salaried individuals and 8.75% for self-employed applicants. It's important to remember that these are starting rates, and the actual rate you qualify for may vary. In addition, you must keep in mind that home loan interest rates are not fixed. They can fluctuate based on various factors, including the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) repo rate. Types of Kotak Home Loans Kotak Mahindra Bank offers a variety of home loan options to suit different needs. Here's a breakdown of some popular choices: 1. Home Loan for Property Purchase: This is the most common type of home loan, allowing you to finance the purchase of a residential or commercial property. It can be used for ready-to-move-in flats, under-construction apartments, or even independent houses. 2.. Home Loan to Buy Land and Self-construction of Property: This option is ideal if you have a specific vision for your dream home and want to construct it yourself. The loan helps finance the purchase of land and provides funds for the construction process. 3. Home Renovation Loan: This loan is perfect for those who want to upgrade their existing living space. You can use the borrowed funds for various renovation projects, from minor repairs and cosmetic improvements to more extensive structural changes. 4. Home Loan Balance Transfer: If you have an existing home loan with another lender and find a more competitive interest rate or better terms with Kotak Mahindra Bank, you can transfer your existing loan. This can potentially help you save money on your monthly repayments. Features of Kotak Home Loan 1. Competitive Interest Rates Kotak Mahindra Bank understands that securing an affordable home loan is a top priority. Their home loan plans offer attractive interest rates that are linked to the RBI's repo rate. This means fluctuations in the market can potentially benefit you, leading to lower EMIs over time. 2. Streamlined Documentation Applying for a home loan shouldn't be a burden. Kotak aims to make the process as smooth as possible by keeping the required documentation minimal. This translates to less paperwork and a quicker turnaround time for your application. 3. Reduced Processing Fees Kotak offers a significant incentive for digitally savvy borrowers. By applying online, you can enjoy a 50% discount on processing fees. This can be a substantial saving, especially for larger loan amounts. 4.

For those who prefer a hands-on approach, you can calculate your EMI using the following formula: Document The EMI calculation is based on a standard mathematical formula: EMI = P × r × (1+ r ) n (1+ r ) n -1 Where: PPP is the principal loan amount r is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12 and then by 100) n is the loan tenure in months (loan tenure in years multiplied by 12) Explanation with an Example
Let’s consider an example to illustrate the calculation: Loan Amount (P): ₹40,00,000 Annual Interest Rate: 8.7% Loan Tenure: 30 years Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 8.7 12 × 100 = 0.00725 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 30 × 12 = 360 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 40,00,000 × 0.00725 × (1+0.00725) 360 ( 1+0.00725 ) 360 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 40,00,000 × 0.00725 × 13.4716 13.4716 - 1 EMI = 390676.4 12.4716 EMI ≈ ₹31,325 So, the monthly EMI for a loan amount of ₹40,00,000 at an 8.70% annual interest rate over 30 years would be approximately ₹31,325.

Let’s consider an example to illustrate the calculation: Loan Amount (P): ₹40,00,000 Annual Interest Rate: 9% Loan Tenure: 30 years Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 9 12 × 100 = 0.0075 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 30 × 12 = 360 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 40,00,000 × 0.0075 × (1+0.0075) <5sup>360 ( 1+0.0075 ) 360 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 40,00,000 × 0.0075 × 14.730576 14.730576 - 1 EMI = 4,41,917.28 13.730576 EMI ≈ ₹32,185 So, the monthly EMI for a loan amount of ₹40,00,000 at an 9% annual interest rate over 30 years would be approximately ₹32,185.

How reliable is LIC's home loan EMI calculator? LIC's home loan calculator is meant to offer an accurate estimate of your prospective EMI depending on the loan amount, interest rate, and term.

The National Pension System (NPS), previously known as National Pension Scheme, is an investment instrument offered by the Central Government. The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) regulates the NPS, ensuring maximum security. You may invest in NPS regularly during your working years and create substantial wealth for retirement. Once you retire, a portion of the accumulated maturity amount will become available for withdrawal. And you will receive the rest as a monthly pension. Any Indian resident can invest in NPS. You can benefit from this pension scheme if you are a government, private or unorganized sector employee. But, before investing in NPS, you must learn how the scheme works. To understand this, use an NPS calculator online to get an idea about the returns the scheme can generate. The benefits of NPS NPS has become a popular investment avenue over the last few years due to its substantial returns and security. The scheme offers many other benefits that make it a suitable investment option for everyone. Here are five noteworthy advantages of NPS. 1. High returns When investing to build a retirement fund, your focus should be to earn high returns. And NPS can offer that as it has historically provided 8% to 10% annual interest for more than a decade. When you invest in NPS, the fund managers put a portion of the money in equity-based investment options. That is how NPS generates higher returns than most other tax-saving schemes. Additionally, if you are not satisfied with the returns, the scheme allows you to change the fund manager as well. 2. Stabilized risk Equity-linked investment products are generally risky as market volatility can affect their returns. But NPS is a safe option as the scheme systematically stabilizes the risk. If you are a government employee, NPS allows you to invest only up to 50% of your total fund in equities. The limit is between 50% and 70% for non-government employees. After you reach 50 years, the scheme’s equity exposure automatically starts to reduce by 2.5% every year. If you are 60 years or more, the equity exposure limit will become fixed at 50%. This systematic stabilization balances risk and returns, ensuring that your money is safe. If all these seem too complicated, you can use a National Pension Scheme calculator. It will quickly give you a maturity amount estimation without any hassles. 3. Tax benefits One benefit of NPS that makes it lucrative is the tax deductions it offers. The contributions you and your employer make towards NPS are tax-deductible up to ₹1.5 lakhs. The self-contributed amount is tax exemptible under subsection 80CCD (1) of Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The deduction limit is 10% of your salary or ₹1.5 lakhs, whichever is lower. The tax benefit for the employer’s contribution is covered under Section 80CCD (2). If you are self-employed, the tax deduction limit is 20% of your gross income under subsection 80CCD (1). But you will not get any exemption under Section 80CCD (2). Under Section 80CCD (2), the tax deduction limit is whichever is the lowest from the following. Employer’s NPS contribution Total gross income 10% of basic pay and Dearness Allowance (DA) Additionally, Section 80CCD (1B) allows a tax deduction of up to ₹50,000 on your contribution to the NPS account. So, you can get a total tax exemption of up to ₹2 lakhs using the benefits offered by Sections 80CCD (1) and 80CCD (1B). 4. Emergency withdrawal You may withdraw up to 60% of your accumulated NPS fund after the age of 60 years. You will get the remaining amount as pension paid on a regular basis from an insurance firm registered under PFRDA. Moreover, the withdrawn amount is tax-exempted. It is always advisable to stay invested in the NPS until you retire, allowing your money to grow into significant wealth. But NPS allows you to withdraw up to 25% of the fund for emergency purposes after staying invested for at least three years. The reasons for withdrawal can be medical treatment for yourself or your family, buying or building a house, higher education or wedding of children, and other purposes. You can withdraw the money three times during the investment tenure with a minimum gap of five years between each withdrawal. 5. Equity allocation flexibility The Scheme E of NPS lets you invest up to 50% of the money in equity-based options. You may decide between active and auto choices for equity investments. If you select the former, you will have the freedom to decide how much to invest in equities within the set limit. The latter decides the equity contributions as per your age. The older you get, the lower will be the equity allocation, thereby reducing risk. The formula for calculating the NPS amount NPS offers compound interest like any other high-return investment product. You can use an NPS calculator to determine how much return you can expect from your investment within seconds. But, if you want to understand how the calculation works, it is important to learn the NPS formula, which uses multiple components: A : Maturity amount P : Principal amount invested r : Annual interest rate n : Number of times the interest is compounded t : Tenure of investment Based on the above components, the formula is A = P x (1 + r/n) n.t Let us understand the formula with the help of an example. Suppose you are presently 34 years old and decide to start contributing ₹3,000 a month to the NPS account. If you get an interest rate of 10% during the investment tenure of 26 years, the maturity amount will be ₹44.35 lakhs for a total contribution of ₹9.36 lakhs. Using an NPS return calculator, you can determine the expected profit based on your age and monthly investment. How to use the NPS calculator The NPS calculator is quick and easy to use with the following five steps. Mention the amount you wish to contribute under the “How much do you want to invest per month?” section. Adjust the slider under “Your Current Age” to input your age. Adjust the slider under “What Is Your Expected Rate of Return?” to input the interest rate of NPS. Adjust the slider under “What Percent Do You Wish to Invest in Annuity?” to mention the percentage of the total contribution you want to be invested in annuity. Adjust the slider under “How Many Years Do You Wish to Invest?” to provide the investment tenure. After you provide the details based on your requirements, the NPS pension calculator will show your total investment, lump-sum value, annuity value, and total maturity amount. Where to invest: NPS vs. PPF Public Provident Fund (PPF) and NPS both are popular investment options in India, especially among people who want to build a substantial retirement fund. The choice depends on your investment goals and risk appetite. Both PPF and NPS offer a variety of benefits but also have fundamental differences. Below table shows a comparative analysis of both the options to help you make an informed decision. Criteria NPS PPF Rate of return Historically provided 8% to 10% interest. The current interest rate offered is 7.1%. The government decides it quarterly. Lock-in period Until retirement 15 years Risk associated Minimum risk as the scheme controls it systematically. But NPS is linked to the market. So, it is not completely risk-free. No risk as the investment is not linked to the market. Tax benefits Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 offers a tax deduction of up to ₹ 1.5 lakhs on your contribution. Another ₹ 50,000 of tax deduction is available under Section 80CCD(1B). You can get a tax deduction of up to ₹ 1.5 lakhs on your investment under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. As you can see from the above information, NPS has the potential to offer higher maturity benefits. So, if you are willing to take a little risk, NPS will help you build a more sizable retirement fund than PPF. How does the NPS work? NPS has two stages: accumulation and retirement. Accumulation : During this stage, NPS uses your contribution to accumulate funds by reinvesting the money in different options like debt instruments, equities, treasury bills, and government bonds. The growth continues until your retirement. Retirement : After retirement, you can withdraw up to 60% of the NPS fund. The remaining amount is used to invest in annuity plans that pay regular returns. FAQs related to the NPS calculator 1.  Who can use the NPS calculator? Anyone eligible to invest in NPS can use the calculator. Presently, Indians between the age of 18 and 60 years can contribute to the scheme. If you belong to the group, the calculator will help you instantly get an idea about the potential returns. 2. What does the calculator show? Once you input the investment amount, age, expected rate of return, and other required information, the calculator will reflect the following four things. Total investment Lump-sum value Annuity value Total maturity amount There are eight fund managers currently offering NPS in India. Before investing, you may check the net promoter score calculation to determine which service providers are more reliable and offer good returns while lowering the risks.

Let’s consider an example to illustrate the calculation: Loan Amount (P): ₹1,00,000 Annual Interest Rate: 16% Loan Tenure: 3 years Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 16 12 × 100 = 0.01333 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 3 × 12 = 36 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 1,00,000 × 0.01333 × (1+0.01333) 36 ( 1+0.01333 ) 36 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 1,00,000 × 0.01333 × 1.6107 1.6107 - 1 EMI = 2147.0631 0.6107 EMI ≈ ₹3,516 So, the monthly EMI for a ₹100,000 loan at 16% annual interest over 36 months would be approximately ₹3,516 .

Factors Affecting Personal Loan EMI Calculation When figuring out your monthly payments (EMIs) for a personal loan, a few things matter. Understanding these can help you plan your finances better and choose a loan that fits your budget. Here's what affects your EMIs: 1. Loan Amount : The total amount you borrow is a key factor in determining your EMI. Generally, a larger loan amount leads to higher EMIs. 2. Interest Rate: The interest rate charged on the loan plays a significant role in calculating EMIs. Higher interest rates result in higher EMIs, while lower rates reduce the monthly payment. Interest rates can be fixed or variable, which can affect how your EMIs change over time. 3. Loan Tenure: Longer loan terms mean lower monthly payments but higher overall interest costs. Shorter terms have higher monthly payments but lower overall interest costs. 4. Fees: Processing fees and other charges can add to the total cost of the loan and affect your monthly payments. 5. Prepayment and Foreclosure: If you plan to pay off your loan early , be aware of any penalties or charges that may apply. These can impact your monthly payments. Closing Thoughts A personal loan EMI calculator is a simple yet powerful tool that can take the guesswork out of your financial planning. By helping you understand your monthly obligations, it allows you to make better-informed decisions about taking on a loan. Give it a try to see how it can work for you. Frequently Asked Questions 1.

For those who prefer a hands-on approach, you can calculate your EMI using the following formula: Document The EMI calculation is based on a standard mathematical formula: EMI = P × r × (1+ r ) n (1+ r ) n -1 Where: PPP is the principal loan amount r is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12 and then by 100) n is the loan tenure in months (loan tenure in years multiplied by 12) Explanation with an Example
Let’s consider an example to illustrate the calculation: Loan Amount (P): ₹25,00,000 Annual Interest Rate: 9.50% Loan Tenure: 25 years Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 9.50 12 × 100 = 0.007916 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 25 × 12 = 300 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 25,00,000 × 0.007916 × (1+0.007916) 300 ( 1+0.007916 ) 300 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 25,00,000 × 0.007916 × 10.648828 10.648828 - 1 EMI = 2,10,740.30612 9.648828 EMI ≈ ₹28,842 So, the monthly EMI for a loan amount of ₹25,00,000 at an 9.50% annual interest rate over 25 years would be approximately ₹28,842.

How to Apply for a Piramal Home Loan? Applying for a Piramal Home Loan is a straightforward process. First, head over to the Piramal Housing Finance website and fill out a simple online application form. You'll need to provide some basic information about yourself. After submitting the form, a representative from Piramal will reach out to you to go over your loan options based on your profile. Once you’ve chosen a loan option that suits you, you’ll need to gather some documents. This includes proof of your identity, address, and income. Piramal Finance makes it easy by accepting both physical documents and digital copies for verification. After your documents are processed, a loan officer will get in touch to set up a time for a property valuation. This step is important because it helps determine the value of the property you're looking to purchase. If everything checks out and the property is approved, your loan application will move forward, and you’ll receive an approval letter if you meet the eligibility criteria. The final step involves signing the loan agreement and any other necessary documents. Once you’ve signed everything, the loan amount will be transferred directly to the seller’s account, allowing you to move ahead with your home purchase. Eligibility Criteria for Piramal Home Loan For Salaried Individuals Minimum Age : You need to be at least 21 years old to apply. Maximum Age : If you’re a government employee and your pension is considered, you can apply until you're 70. For other salaried individuals, the maximum age limit is usually 62 or up to the retirement age, whichever comes first. Employment Background : You can qualify if you work in a government organisation, public sector undertaking, or private companies like limited or private limited firms. This also includes multinational corporations (MNCs), partnership firms, sole proprietorships, and institutions run by trusts, NGOs, or societies. For Self-Employed Individuals Minimum Age : You should be at least 23 years old to qualify. Maximum Age : The maximum age for applying is 70 years. Types of Self-Employment : This category includes self-employed professionals like qualified doctors (MBBS, MD, MS), chartered accountants (CAs), and architects. It also covers self-employed non-professionals, business owners, partners in partnership firms, and directors of privately held companies. However, if you’re a director of a publicly listed company, you’ll be treated as a salaried employee. Before applying for a Piramal home loan, make sure you meet these age and employment criteria to ensure a smoother application process. Frequently Asked Questions 1. Do I get any tax benefit on the Piramal home loan? Yes, if you have a Piramal home loan, you can enjoy some tax benefits. Under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, you can claim a tax deduction of up to ₹1.5 lakh on the principal amount you repay each financial year. Additionally, Section 24(b) allows you to deduct up to ₹2 lakh on the interest you pay on your home loan in a financial year. These deductions can help reduce your taxable income, which is a nice perk for borrowers. 2. How can I estimate the eligible home loan amount? To figure out how much home loan you might be eligible for, lenders look at several factors. They consider your income, the length of the loan, interest rates, and any existing monthly EMI payments you have. They also check the EMI to Net Monthly Income (NMI) ratio, which is a guideline to ensure you can afford the loan. Some lenders might also use a different method called the multiplier method to calculate your eligibility. Keep in mind that the amount you can borrow may differ from one lender to another. This is because each lender has its own criteria, such as interest rates and the EMI/NMI ratio. To get a clearer picture of how much you can borrow, it's a good idea to use the home loan eligibility calculator available on the lender’s website. 3. Is there any relaxation in the home loan repayment schedule? Many lenders offer options for flexibility in the home loan repayment schedule, especially if you encounter financial difficulties. This can include options like extending the loan tenure or temporarily reducing the EMI amount. It’s important to discuss these options with your lender if you feel you may need some breathing room in your repayment schedule. Always make sure to read the terms and conditions associated with any changes to your loan. In this article Calculators Similar articles that might interest you!

You can put a minimum of ₹500 and a maximum of ₹1.5 lakhs in the PPF account during a financial year. Moreover, the current rate of interest offered on PPF is 7.1%. However, before investing in this instrument, it is advisable to use a PPF calculator online and get a clear idea about the expected returns.

Determine how frequently you want to invest, how much you can deposit in the account, and if you wish to stay invested after the lock-in period. All these aspects can make the calculation rather tricky and time-consuming. And this is when the PPF calculator comes to your rescue. The rate of interest on PPF is periodically determined by the Central Government. The calculator considers the rate of interest prevalent at the time of investment and provides you with the result accordingly. In simple words, it is a tool that will tell you how much profit you can generate by investing in PPF. How the PPF Calculator Can Help You? PPF can be confusing, especially for first-time investors. The calculator makes it easy for everyone to keep an eye on their account balance and growth. It can also help resolve your queries about the changing interest rates or how they affect your maturity value. The tool accurately calculates your potential profit and shows you the data within seconds. The best thing is that you only need to provide some basic information such as deposit amount, investment frequency, and tenure. Thereafter, you can automatically see the current PPF interest rate on the calculator. This makes the calculations quick and easy for you. Formula and procedure used for calculating the PPF interest PPF offers compound interest, which is calculated on the available balance annually. The formula has different components: F: Maturity benefit P: Annual installments n: Number of years i: Interest rate/100 The PPF formula: F = P x [({(1+i) n } - 1)/i] Let us understand this with an example. Suppose you invest ₹1 lakh to the account every year for 15 years, and the rate of interest is 7.1%. Using the above formula, your estimated maturity amount is: 1 lakh x [({(1+i) 15 }-1)/i] = ₹31,17,276. How to use PPF Calculator? The latest PPF calculator 2020-21 is easy to use. Check out the below instructions to get the result quickly. 1. Frequency of Investment This is generally the first step to follow. There are 4 options under this section: Monthly, Quarterly, Half-Yearly, and Yearly. You may choose one based on how often you want to invest in the PPF account in a financial year. 2. Deposit Amount Under this option, you must enter your preferred investment amount for the payment frequency you chose earlier. You may invest up to ₹1.5 lakhs a year. 3. Current PPF Balance This section is for those who already have an accumulated balance in the PPF account. If you are investing for the first time, leave it blank, it will show ₹0. Otherwise, mention the balance amount you have. 4. Duration of Investment You will find a slider under this section that ranges from 15 years to 70 years. You can adjust it depending on your preferred investment term. After selecting the tenure, the calculator will automatically determine the estimated returns based on your inputs and the current rate of interest offered by the government. On the left side of the calculator, you will find the amounts for the total investment made, total interest earned, and the maturity value. How PPF is Calculated? The return on your account balance is calculated monthly based on the interest rate offered in that quarter. But the PPF credits the interest earned during a financial year only when the year ends. For the monthly calculation, the lowest amount recorded in your account from the 5th day of a month to the last day of that month is considered. Suppose your PPF balance on 1st April 2021 is ₹10,000, and you deposit another ₹30,000 on 3rd April 2021. In this scenario, the interest will be calculated on ₹40,000. But, if you deposit ₹30,000 on 6th April 2021, the interest will be calculated only on ₹10,000. Also, PPF offers compound interest on your balance. So, at the end of each year, the interest is calculated on your total balance (principal amount and the interest already earned). Moreover, you may remain invested in the PPF after the lock-in period even without making additional deposits. You will still receive annually compounded returns on the balance amount. Advantages of PPF Calculator The calculator serves many purposes, making it a helpful tool for both new and experienced investors. Here are five ways the calculator can help you. 1. Resolves queries If you are unsure of how PPF works, the calculator can help. When you input different figures on the tool, you can see how it works. If you have any queries about PPF, the results generated on the calculator will help resolve them. 2. Helps make investment decisions PPF does not require a fixed investment amount. You may choose the sum and investment frequency depending on your comfort. When you provide the required information, it shows the return you can expect at the end of 15 years. You can make investment decisions based on that. 3. Can be used multiple times There is no limit to how many times you can use the PPF account calculator. So, you can try out different investment amounts and frequencies multiple times. This way, you will be able to figure out how much to invest to get your desired return. 4. Error-free results Manual calculations always leave room for human errors, especially if you have to do it frequently. The calculator is an automated tool that eliminates the possibility of errors and provides precise data every time. 5. Helps with tax planning PPF is a tax-saving investment product. So, you may use the calculator when planning your taxes to determine how much you can save by putting your money in PPF. You can strategize your investments accordingly. 6. Reflects wealth accumulation period PPF allows you to continue investing even after the lock-in period. So, if you are planning long-term investments for wealth creation, you can use the calculator to check potential growth beyond the initial 15 years.

Loan paid to date How do you calculate RBL Bank Home Loan EMI?

Let’s consider an example to illustrate the calculation: Loan Amount (P): ₹40,00,000 Annual Interest Rate: 9% Loan Tenure: 30 years Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 9 12 × 100 = 0.0075 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 30 × 12 = 360 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 40,00,000 × 0.0075 × (1+0.0075) 360 ( 1+0.0075 ) 360 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 40,00,000 × 0.0075 × 14.730576 14.730576 - 1 EMI = 4,41,917.28 13.730576 EMI ≈ ₹32,185 So, the monthly EMI for a loan amount of ₹40,00,000 at an 9% annual interest rate over 30 years would be approximately ₹32,185.

There are multiple ways you can compare different investment options to determine which offers the highest returns. One popular method is the Return on Investment (ROI). You can use an ROI calculator to compare different investment products quickly. What is Return on Investment (ROI)? ROI shows the ratio between total profits made from an investment and the total investment cost. Simply put, you can use the ROI method to compare the invested amount and the income earned. It also helps understand the profitability of an investment option and decide if it is a good choice for you. Another important aspect of ROI is that you get the answer in percentage form. So, if the calculation shows the result is 0.20, it means the ROI is 20%. ROI is a commonly used method to calculate investment profitability because it is quick and simple. Moreover, the data required for ROI is easy to determine; you know how much money you will invest, and most investment products show the potential returns. Additionally, ROI shows the result in percentage form, which is easy to understand. It makes comparing different investment options a simple task, allowing you to choose the best financial instrument. One essential thing to know about ROI is that it refers to different types of measurements, which include Average Rate of Return (ARR), Earnings per Share (EPS), and the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). But investors use it more frequently to measure the simple return on investment. You can estimate ROI in seconds by using an ROI calculator online. About ROI calculator The calculator allows you to compute ROI effortlessly. It has sections where you need to provide the investment amount and expected returns. You must also mention the investment period for the tool to work. Once you input the details, the calculator will show you the Gain on Investment, Return on Investment, Absolute ROI, and Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). The formula to measure ROI The calculator makes it simple for you to determine the ROI, but it is always wise to learn how the ROI formula works. It plays a crucial role in investments and can make all the difference between choosing the right investment product and suffering loss. To use the formula, you need Gain from Investment (G) and Cost of Investment (C). Based on the above information, the formula is ROI = [(G – C) / C]. You can multiply the result by 100 to determine ROI percentage. One disadvantage of the formula is that it only considers the numerical values provided but cannot calculate the associated risk with any investment instrument. How does the ROI calculator work? Now that you know how to calculate ROI using the formula, it is time to understand how the calculator works with the equation. When you input investment amount, expected returns, and investment period, the calculator uses the above formula to determine Absolute Return. It then shows the value in percentage form. As you can see, calculating the Absolute Return does not require using the investment period. But the calculator needs the information to determine Annualized Return on Investment, which is the investment product’s performance over different periods. The formula for Annualized ROI is more extensive compared to Absolute Return. Let us understand both aspects of using ROI with different examples. Example of ROI calculation Suppose you bought a property worth ₹60 lakhs, and you sell it for ₹90 lakhs after 5 years. By using the formula, [(G – C) / C], we get the Absolute Return: (₹90 lakhs – ₹60 lakhs) / ₹60 lakhs = 0.50. So, the return on the investment in your property is 50%. Annualized Return on Investment (ROI) formula and example The basic ROI calculation formula does not include the period during which you held the investment, which is the holding period. If you want to take the holding period into account, Annualized ROI can help. The formula for Annualized ROI: [(1+ROI) 1/n − 1] x 100% In the formula, ‘n’ is the holding period in terms of the number of years. Let us apply the same example as above to understand how the calculation for Annualized ROI works. Investment : ₹60 lakhs Total return : ₹90 lakhs ROI : 0.50 Holding period : 5 years So, the Annualized ROI is [(1 + 0.50) 1/5 − 1] x 100% = 8.45%. If the holding period is less than a year, you can still use the formula by converting ‘n’ into a fraction of a year. Check the below Annualized ROI calculation example: ROI : 0.10 Holding period : 6 months = 0.5 years So, the Annualized ROI will be: [(1 + 0.10) 1/0.5 − 1] x 100% = 21% Benefits of ROI ROI calculation offers many benefits. Below is a list of the six most significant ones. 1. Easy profitability measurement ROI provides you with a clear idea about the profitability of an investment option. This allows you to compare different products to determine which one can generate the most profit quickly. So, you can use your available assets better and get the best out of your investment. You may also compare the cost with the profit of each investment product to determine their rate of return. 2. Increasing overall profit If you maintain a diversified investment portfolio, you can measure the overall ROI of the portfolio and the ROI of every individual investment plan. This makes it easy to measure the profitability of every financial product under the portfolio and determine where you can make improvements. When the ROI of one instrument improves, the overall ROI increases. 3. Quick comparative analysis If you want to invest in stocks, it is important to compare different companies in their asset utilization and productivity before deciding where to put your hard-earned money. ROI becomes even more essential when comparing businesses of similar size, belonging to the same industry. You may use the ROI calculation to analyze the different companies’ profitability closely, allowing you to make an informed choice. 4. Performance measurement A key factor of maintaining a profitable investment portfolio is keeping a close eye on every asset. ROI helps you determine which options are performing well and which are not. Based on that, you can buy and sell products from your portfolio to ensure maximum profits. If you want to invest your money in a fund, ROI will also help compare the performance of different funds. You may then choose the one that has been performing well over the years. 5. Choosing an investment company If you are considering using the services of an investment company, there are multiple things you have to first check. The company must be excellent at asset utilization, cost management, pricing strategy, and marketing apart from investment planning. A company with a high ROI percentage shows the signs of being good at what they do. 6. Simplicity of use The data required to calculate ROI is readily available. You only need to know the investment cost and probable returns to calculate ROI. So, it is a simple procedure that almost anyone can use to make the right investment decisions. Drawbacks of ROI ROI has a few limitations, too. Three of its drawbacks are as follows: 1.  Definition of profit differs The word ‘profit’ may have different definitions. The amount of profit from an investment product depends on multiple factors such as taxes and interests. Some instruments might even have associated costs that are deducted from the return, lowering your profits. As ROI does not take all these into account, the result might not always be accurate. 2.  Difficult to compare different companies Development expenditure, fixed asset valuations, stock price assessment, and many other financial aspects vary between companies. So, a simple comparison of different companies based on ROI might not always offer a clear picture. 3.  Does not account for risk ROI only accounts for Gain from Investment and Cost of Investment. It ignores multiple other factors associated with an investment, such as risk. An investment product with a high rate of return can be risky as well. As ROI does not consider that, the result might not always be precise. FAQs 1.  Why does the ROI calculator show both Absolute Return and Annualized ROI? Absolute Return only shows your profit percentage from any investment held for one year or less. To compare returns during an extended holding period, you need to use the Annualized ROI calculation. 2. How can the ROI calculator help? The calculator makes it easy to compare different investment products. It gives you an idea about which investment avenue has a better chance of providing higher returns. 3. Is it difficult to use the ROI calculator? No, the calculator is quite easy to use. You only need to input the investment amount, expected returns, and investment period on the tool. It will do the rest and show you the result within seconds. Many investors use the ROI calculator in India. It can be a great tool if you know how to use it properly.

Basic Salary HRA Other Allowances Provident Fund Professional Tax Total Deductions Net Salary Income Tax Net Salary Post Tax Jupiter's Salary Calculator tool can also help you calculate salary per month. Just toggle the 'Yearly/Monthly' option to 'Monthly'. Components of Your Salary Slip In every professional field, employees get paid at the end of the month by their employers. This payment is called the salary. The amount they receive is usually mentioned in their contract as well as the pay slip. The salary has many components that may vary among different employers. Below is a list of the most common breakdown of the salary structure. 1.  Basic salary It is a part of the Cost to Company (CTC) that the employers pay to the employees for their services. The basic salary is generally around 40% to 50% of your total salary. There is no formula to calculate this amount. It depends on factors like the industry, employee designation, and much more. 2.  House Rent Allowance (HRA) Companies pay the HRA to employees who stay in a rented property. The HRA amount equals 50% of the basic salary if you live in metro cities. For the non-metro cities, the amount is 40% of your basic salary. Section 10 (13A) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 makes the HRA partially or fully tax exemptible. But, if you do not stay in a rented property, the entire component is taxable. Calculate HRA 3.  Leave Travel Allowance (LTA) Employers pay this benefit for you and your family’s domestic travel expenses during a holiday. The allowance only covers railway ticket prices and airfares. Section 10(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 offers tax exemption on the LTA amount for up to two holidays in a four-calendar-year block. You need to submit proof of travel to receive the tax benefit. 4.  Special Allowance This is a fixed amount your employer may pay above your basic salary. The Special Allowance varies among companies as it depends on multiple factors. Moreover, it is fully taxable. 5.  Bonus Bonus is a component of the gross salary that the employers may pay as a performance encouragement. The entire bonus amount is fully taxable. 6.  Employee Provident Fund (EPF) It is generally a mandatory savings scheme. You need to pay 12% of your basic salary as an EPF contribution. Moreover, your employer matches your contribution and invests the same amount in your EPF account. Your contribution is tax-deductible up to ₹1.5 lakhs under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act , 1961. The employer’s contribution to EPF is a part of the CTC, and it does not appear on the salary slip . Calculate EPF Salary Calculation Formula As the salary calculations involve various components, you need to use different formulas to calculate each aspect. Only then you can estimate your take-home salary. Here are some important salary calculation formulas that you must know. Take-Home Salary = Gross Salary – (Income Tax + Employee Provident Fund (EPF) + Professional Tax (if applicable)) Gross Salary = Basic Salary + Allowances + Bonuses + Overtime Pay (if applicable) Gratuity = (Basic Salary + Dearness Allowance) × 15 × (Years of Service) ÷ 26 Taxable Income = Gross Salary - EPF/PPF Contribution - Tax-Free Allowances - HRA - LTA - Health Insurance Premiums - Tax-Saving Investments (e.g., 80C, 80D) - Other Deductions (e.g., Standard Deduction, Home Loan Interest) How to Calculate Monthly Take-Home Salary? Your monthly take-home salary is the amount that remains after subtracting the total deductions from gross pay. Let us understand the calculations using examples. 1. Gross Salary: ₹1,000,000 2. Deductions: Basic Salary (50% of Gross Salary): ₹1,000,000 × 50% = ₹500,000 Employee Provident Fund (EPF Contribution) – 12% of Basic Salary:  ₹500,000 × 12% = ₹60,000 Professional Tax (average): ₹2,500 (varies by state) 3. Income Tax Calculation - India’s 2024-25 (AY 2025-26): As announced in the Union Budget 2024, the income tax slabs under the new tax regime have been revised. These updated rates will take effect from 1st April 2025, and will be applicable for the Assessment Year 2025-26. The revised income tax slabs for salaried individuals are as follows: New Regime (FY 2024-25) Range of Income (Rs.) Tax Rate Up to 3,00,000 NIL 3,00,000-7,00,000 5% 7,00,000-10,00,000 10% 10,00,000-12,00,000 15% 12,00,000-15,00,000 20% Above 15,00,000 30% Here’s the simple income tax calculation for a salary of ₹10,00,000 under the New Tax Regime for FY 2024–25 (AY 2025–26): First ₹3,00,000: No tax (₹0) Next ₹4,00,000 (₹3,00,001 – ₹7,00,000): ₹4,00,000 × 5% = ₹20,000 Next ₹3,00,000 (₹7,00,001 – ₹10,00,000): ₹3,00,000 × 10% = ₹30,000 Total Tax: ₹0 (for first ₹3,00,000) + ₹20,000 (for next ₹4,00,000) + ₹30,000 (for the last ₹3,00,000) = ₹50,000 4. Total Deductions: Income Tax: ₹50,000 EPF: ₹60,000 Professional Tax: ₹2,500 Total Deductions: ₹50,000 + ₹60,000 + ₹2,500 = ₹1,12,500 5. Take-Home Salary: Gross Salary - Total Deductions = ₹1,000,000 - ₹1,12,500 = ₹8,87,500 Final Take-Home Salary: ₹8,87,500 How to Calculate Take Home Salary After Taxes? Everyone is curious what their take home pay will be once an organization decides the appraisal for the employee or share the new offer letter to a candidate. Let's breakdown how to calculate take home pay after the taxation. Firstly you have to find out your taxable income. All the variables are explained above as well. Assumptions: Gross Salary: ₹1,000,000 EPF Contribution: 12% of basic salary (assuming basic salary is 50% of gross salary) HRA Exemption: We’ll assume 40% of basic salary as HRA and 50% of that as exempt. LTA Exemption: ₹20,000 (assumed) Health Insurance Premium: ₹15,000 (assumed under Section 80D) Tax-Saving Investments (e.g., under 80C): ₹150,000 (maximum allowed) Standard Deduction: ₹50,000 (as per 2023-24 rules) Now, let’s calculate each component. For a gross salary of ₹1,000,000, the taxable income is calculated as ₹605,000, after accounting for EPF, HRA exemption, LTA, health insurance premiums, tax-saving investments, and the standard deduction. Breakdown of Deductions: EPF Contribution (12% of basic salary): ₹60,000 HRA Exemption (50% of HRA): ₹100,000 LTA Exemption: ₹20,000 Health Insurance Premium: ₹15,000 Tax-Saving Investments (80C): ₹150,000 Standard Deduction: ₹50,000 Total deductions: 60,000 + 100000 + 20000 + 15000 + 150000 + 50000 = 395000 Net Taxable Income after Taxes: ₹10,00,000 -  3,95,000 = 6,05,000 Total deductions reduce the gross salary to arrive at the taxable income of ₹605,000 . How to Calculate Gratuity? Gratuity = (Basic Salary + Dearness Allowance) × 15 × (Years of Service) ÷ 26 Gross Salary = ₹1,000,000 Basic Salary = 50% of Gross Salary = ₹500,000 Dearness Allowance (DA) = ₹0 (Assumed) Years of Service = 20 years Calculation: Basic Salary = ₹500,000 (50% of ₹1,000,000) Dearness Allowance (DA) = ₹0 (Assumed DA is not applicable) Total of Basic Salary + DA = ₹500,000 + ₹0 = ₹500,000 Gratuity Calculation: formula Gratuity = (500,000) × 15 × 20 26 = ( 500,000 × 300 ) 26 = 150,000,0000 26 = ₹5,769,231 Gratuity Amount :- ₹5,769,231 Benefits of Salary Calculator in India Quick Results: Jupiter’s salary calculator shows take-home pay within seconds.

For those who prefer a hands-on approach, you can calculate your EMI using the following formula: Document The EMI calculation is based on a standard mathematical formula: EMI = P × r × (1+ r ) n (1+ r ) n -1 Where: PPP is the principal loan amount r is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12 and then by 100) n is the loan tenure in months (loan tenure in years multiplied by 12) Explanation with an Example
Let’s consider an example to illustrate the calculation: Loan Amount (P): ₹30,00,000 Annual Interest Rate: 8.70% Loan Tenure: 20 years Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 8.70 12 × 100 = 0.00725 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 20 × 12 = 240 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 30,00,000 × 0.00725 × (1+0.00725) 240 ( 1+0.00725 ) 240 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 30,00,000 × 0.00725 × 5.661692 5.661692 - 1 EMI = 1,23,141.801 4.661692 EMI ≈ ₹26,416 So, the monthly EMI for a loan amount of ₹30,00,000 at an 8.70% annual interest rate over 20 years would be approximately ₹26,416.

For those who prefer a hands-on approach, you can calculate your EMI using the following formula: Document The EMI calculation is based on a standard mathematical formula: EMI = P × r × (1+ r ) n (1+ r ) n -1 Where: PPP is the principal loan amount r is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12 and then by 100) n is the loan tenure in months (loan tenure in years multiplied by 12) Explanation with an Example
Let’s consider an example to illustrate the calculation: Loan Amount (P): ₹50,00,000 Annual Interest Rate: 8.50% Loan Tenure: 30 years Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 8.5 12 × 100 = 0.007083 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 30 × 12 = 360 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 50,00,000 × 0.007083 × (1+0.007083) 360 ( 1+0.007083 ) 360 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 50,00,000 × 0.007083 × 12.6909 12.6909 - 1 EMI = 449,448.2235 11.6909 EMI ≈ ₹38,446 So, the monthly EMI for a loan amount of ₹50,00,000 at an 8.50% annual interest rate over 30 years would be approximately ₹38,446.

Step 2: Get Legal Advice: Take all the required legal documents to an SBI-approved lawyer for verification. They'll typically review the Sales Agreement and Construction Agreement. Sometimes, additional documents like an Encumbrance Certificate or property tax receipts might be needed. This step can take the longest due to collecting documents from various sources. Step 3: Property Valuation: After legal verification, an SBI-approved property valuer will assess your property. They'll provide you with a valuation letter upon completion. Step 4: E-stamping or Franking Agreements: SBI home loans require franking or e-stamping of the Sales and Construction Agreement. The e-stamping cost depends on your property value. You can get it done at a register office (franking) or select locations like register offices, post offices, and syndicate banks (e-stamping). Step 5: Submit Your Application: Once you have completed the above steps, visit an SBI branch with the completed application form and all required documents. This typically includes the legal opinion, property valuation report, and any other documents requested by the bank. Step 6: Waiting for Approval: The loan approval time can vary depending on individual circumstances. In some cases, the special home loan branch may disburse the loan within three days. However, regular follow-ups with the bank can help expedite the process. Step 7: Additional Documents: SBI will contact you after loan approval and request some additional documents, such as: Two e-stamps worth Rs.400 (you as first party, SBI as second party) One e-stamp worth Rs.200 (same parties as above) One e-stamp worth Rs.200 (guarantor as first party, SBI as second party) All documents submitted during the initial application Cheques payable to State Bank of India You and your guarantor will need to be present at the bank with all these documents. Step 8: Loan Disbursement: Once the loan is approved, you'll need to obtain the following documents from the builder: NOC (No Objection Certificate) stating the property isn't mortgaged elsewhere Tripartite agreement (if the property is under construction) Demand note from the builder matching the payment schedule Step 9: Registration: Before property registration, verify the stamp duty and inform the bank. After registration, an SBI bank officer will visit you to deliver a Demand Draft (DD) to the builder, or you might be asked to collect it from your branch.

Manually crunching numbers, factoring in interest rates, and determining monthly instalments can be time-consuming and prone to errors. This is where a home loan calculator steps in as a valuable tool. An online calculator, like the UCO Bank Home Loan Calculator, simplifies the process by providing accurate and instant results. With just a few inputs, you can get a clear picture of your potential home loan repayment, helping you make informed decisions about your dream home. What is the UCO Bank Home Loan EMI Calculator? The UCO Bank Home Loan EMI Calculator is a useful online tool that helps homeowners calculate their Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI) or monthly loan repayment amount. It takes into account various factors such as the loan amount, interest rate, and loan tenure to determine the EMI. The calculator is easily accessible on the Jupiter Money website and can assist borrowers with their financial planning. What is the UCO Bank Home Loan Interest Rate? UCO Bank provides home loans with interest rates starting at 8.40% per annum. This further goes up to 10% and more for terms up to 30 years, covering up to 90% of the property's purchase price. The exact interest rate varies based on factors such as credit history, employment status (self-employed or salaried), and the specific home loan plan selected. To find out the exact interest rate you may qualify for, it is recommended to contact a UCO Bank Home Loan Representative. Types of UCO Bank Home Loan UCO Bank offers three primary home loan options to cater to different borrower needs: 1. UCO Home Loan This is a standard home loan designed to help individuals purchase or construct a house. The loan amount and terms can be customised based on the borrower’s specific requirements. 2. UCO Pre-Approved Home Loan This loan provides borrowers with a preliminary approval even before they've selected a property. This can streamline the home-buying process by allowing buyers to focus on finding the right property without worrying about loan approval. 3. UCO Top-Up Loan If you already have a home loan with UCO Bank, a top-up loan can provide additional funds for various purposes such as home renovations, repairs, or other financial needs. Features of UCO Bank Home Loan UCO Bank offers loans to both salaried and self-employed individuals, with special rates for women, senior citizens, and NRI customers. Loans are available for individuals aged 21 to 60 years. The Loan-to-Value Ratio is 90%. Loan tenure ranges from 5 to 30 years. Interest rates range from 8.40% to 10%. The EMI for a UCO Bank home loan starts at Rs. 660 per lakh. The EMI can be easily calculated using the UCO Bank Home Loan Calculator. How to Use the UCO Bank Home Loan Interest Rate EMI Calculator? To help you easily estimate your monthly home loan repayment, we at Jupiter have created a user-friendly calculator. It can provide EMI details for loans from various banks, including UCO Bank. To use the calculator, simply go to the top of this page and enter the following information: Loan Amount: The total cost of the property you plan to purchase. Loan Tenure: The repayment period you prefer, usually between 5 and 30 years. Interest Rate: An estimated interest rate based on your discussions with the bank or the current UCO Bank home loan rates. Once you've entered these details, the calculator will display your estimated monthly EMI, which covers both the principal loan amount and the interest charged. You can experiment with different loan amounts, tenures, and interest rates to see how they impact your EMI. This will help you find the loan option that best suits your budget. How to Calculate UCO Bank Home Loan EMI? For those who prefer a hands-on approach, you can calculate your EMI using the following formula: Document The EMI calculation is based on a standard mathematical formula: EMI = P × r × (1+ r ) n (1+ r ) n -1 Where: PPP is the principal loan amount r is the monthly interest rate (annual interest rate divided by 12 and then by 100) n is the loan tenure in months (loan tenure in years multiplied by 12) Explanation with an Example
Let’s consider an example to illustrate the calculation: Loan Amount (P): ₹30,00,000 Annual Interest Rate: 8.35% Loan Tenure: 30 years Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate: r = 8.35 12 × 100 = 0.006958 Step 2: Convert the loan tenure to months: n = 30 × 12 = 360 Step 3: Plug these values into the formula: EMI = 30,00,000 × 0.006958 × (1+0.006958) 360 ( 1+0.006958 ) 360 -1 Step 4: Calculate the EMI: EMI = 30,00,000 × 0.006958 × 12.1363 12.1363 - 1 EMI = 253334.3357 11.1363 EMI ≈ ₹22,749 So, the monthly EMI for a loan amount of ₹30,00,000 at an 8.35% annual interest rate over 30 years would be approximately ₹22,749.

In case your credit limit is breached due to a higher amount presented by the merchant at the time of settlement, there will be no charges levied. ** TDS wherever applicable shall be deducted for the customer as per the rates notified by the government from time to time. *** Fuel surcharge waiver will be offered on fuel spends of up to ₹ 4000 per billing cycle Withdrawal Limits Your Credit Limit will be communicated to you at the time of card issuance. These limits will be mentioned in your monthly statements. Available credit limit is calculated by deducting the utilised limit from the Total Credit Limit. “Available Credit Limit” is the limit up to which you can make purchases. Billing Statement Your billing statement will be generated every month and sent to your registered email address (Refer to the MITC or Jupiter App for the exact dates based on your Billing cycle) It will contain a break-up of all fees, purchases, interest charges, repayments, refunds and taxes. In case the card was not used during the billing cycle, the billing statement will mention there were no spends in that month. Minimum Amount Due When you receive your Edge-Federal Card statement, you can choose to pay the total amount due or or the Minimum Amount Due. Minimum Amount Due stated in the monthly statement shall be calculated as per the following formula: 5% of the total amount due + EMI amount billed for the month + 100% of any fees, interest, charges and taxes If the minimum amount due is less than ₹500, you’ll be charged 500 as the minimum amount due. If the total amount due is less than ₹500 then the total amount due value becomes the minimum amount due. The Minimum Amount Due should be paid before the Payment Due Date. The remaining balance can be carried forward to subsequent months. Note, that paying the minimum amount due would still incur you finance charges on the unpaid bill amount. Method of payment You can pay the outstanding dues from the mobile app using the following modes: •	Auto-debit from your  bank account •	Bank transfer from your bank account •	UPI payments (up to ₹2 lakh or any other such amounts prescribed from time to time) from any virtual payment account added to the Jupiter App. •	Via debit card and net banking through any bank account using a unique payment link sent to you via SMS and email Federal Bank has the right to add/remove any methods of payment at any time. Interest-Free (grace) period Interest-free period, from the start of the billing cycle date, shall be 13 - 47 days (depending on the date of the transaction). However, the interest-free period will not be available if you fail to pay the total amount due of the previous month. The payment due date for the Edge-Federal Credit Card comes at least 14 days after the Statement Generation Date (Please check your statement for your exact Payment Due Date). Therefore, the interest free credit period can range from 13 - 47 days depending on the date of your credit card transaction. Illustrative Example for Interest-Free Period Calculation For a statement for the period from May 1, 2023 to May 30, 2023 the payment due date would be Jun 15, 2023. Assuming that you have paid the Total Amount Due of the previous month statement by the payment due date, the grace period would be: For a purchase dated May 2, 2023, the interest-free grace period is from May 2, 2023 to June 15, 2023, i.e. 45 days. For a purchase dated May 30, 2023, the interest-free grace period is from May 30, 2023 to June 15, 2023, i.e. 17 days. Thus, the grace period can vary depending upon the date of purchase. Note: If the Total Amount Due is not paid by the payment due date, then there will be no interest free period. For cash advances, interest is charged from the date of the transaction until the date of payment. There is an additional three day period (as mandated by the Reserve Bank of India (“ RBI ”) post the payment due date during which if you make a repayment, it is considered a timely repayment. Illustration of Interest Charges Interest will be charged if the Total Amount Due (“ TAD ”) is not paid by the payment due date. Interest will be charged on the outstanding amount due and on all new transactions (from the transaction date) till such time as the total amount due is paid in full. The following example shows how interest is calculated. In the table given below, it has been assumed that the TAD of the previous month’s statement has been paid by the payment due date and there is no outstanding amount. The statement generation date is the 1st. Given these assumptions, interest will be calculated as shown: Date Details 5 March, 2023 Transaction of ₹10,000 27 March, 2023 Transaction of ₹5000 1 April, 2023 Statement generated Total Amount Due: ₹15,000 Minimum Amount Due: ₹750 15 April, 2023 Payment due Total Amount Due: ₹15,000 Minimum Amount Due: ₹750 19 April, 2023 Transaction of ₹1000 21 April 2023 Payment of ₹2000 made On statement dated 1 May 2023, the following interest charges will be levied. Interest is calculated using the following formula: Outstanding transaction amount * Number of days since transaction * (Interest rate x 12 months) / 365 Details Reason Amount Calculation Interest on ₹10,000 for 47 days (from Mar 5 to Apr 20) Interest on entire transaction amount from transaction date till the date of payment ₹579.45 (10000 x 48 x (3.75% x12)) / 365 Interest on ₹8,000 for 10 days (from Apr 21 to Apr 30) Interest on outstanding transaction amount from the date of payment till the next statement date ₹98.63 (8000 x 10 x (3.75% x 12)) / 365 Interest on ₹5,000 for 35 days (from Mar 27 to Apr 30) Interest on entire transaction amount till the next statement date ₹431.51 (10000 x 35 x (3.75% x 12)) / 365 Interest on ₹1,000 for 12 days (from Apr 19 to Apr 30) Since TAD has not been paid, interest free period doesn’t apply on this transaction Interest on entire transaction amount till the next statement date ₹14.79 (1000 x 12 x (3.75% x 12)) / 365 Total Interest Payable Sum of all the above charges ₹1124.38 (₹579.45 + ₹98.63 + ₹431.51 + ₹14.79) GST in applicable on interest charges GST is applicable on all fees, interest, surcharge and other charges ₹202.39 18% x 1124.38 Note: These illustrations are meant to be indicative and to show how interest is calculated and charged.

Illustrative example for calculation of Late Payment Charge: In the example below, consider the billing cycle is 1st of the calendar month - end of the month. Statements are generated on the 1st and are due on the 15th of every month. There is no outstanding at the start of the following cycle. Date Details 2 March, 2023 Transaction of ₹10000 1 April, 2023 Statement generated Total Amount Due: ₹10,000 Minimum Amount Due: ₹ 500 15 April, 2023 Payment due Total Amount Due: ₹10,000 Minimum Amount Due: ₹500 21 April 2023 Payment of ₹ 2000 made 1 May 2023 Late payment charge of ₹ 200 applied 1 May 2023 GST of ₹ 36 on the Late Payment Charge added to bill Note: Late Payment Charge is not applicable when the total outstanding is less than ₹500. Interest Charges Interest will be charged if the Total Amount Due (“ TAD ”) is not paid by the payment due date. Interest will be charged on the outstanding amount due and on all new transactions (from the transaction date) till such time as the total amount due is paid in full. The following example shows how interest is calculated. In the table given 	below, it has been assumed that the Total Amount Due (“ TAD ”) of the previous month’s statement has been paid by the payment due date and there is no outstanding amount. The statement generation date is the 1st. Given these assumptions, interest will be calculated as shown: Date Details 5 March, 2023 Transaction of ₹10,000 27 March, 2023 Transaction of ₹5000 1 April, 2023 Statement generated Total Amount Due: ₹15,000 Minimum Amount Due: ₹750 15 April, 2023 Payment due Total Amount Due: ₹15,000 Minimum Amount Due: ₹750 19 April, 2023 Transaction of ₹1000 21 April 2023 Payment of ₹2000 made 4. On statement dated 1 May 2023, the following interest charges will be levied. Interest is calculated using the following formula: Outstanding transaction amount * Number of days since transaction * (Interest rate x 12 months) / 365 Details Reason Amount Calculation Interest on ₹10,000 for 47 days (from Mar 5 to Apr 20) Interest on entire transaction amount from transaction date till the date of payment ₹579.45 (10000 x 48 x (3.75% x12)) / 365 Interest on ₹8,000 for 10 days (from Apr 21 to Apr 30) Interest on outstanding transaction amount from the date of payment till the next statement date ₹98.63 (8000 x 10 x (3.75% x 12)) / 365 Interest on ₹5,000 for 35 days (from Mar 27 to Apr 30) Interest on entire transaction amount till the next statement date ₹431.51 (10000 x 35 x (3.75% x 12)) / 365 Interest on ₹1,000 for 12 days (from Apr 19 to Apr 30) Since TAD has not been paid, interest free period doesn’t apply on this transaction Interest on entire transaction amount till the next statement date ₹14.79 (1000 x 12 x (3.75% x 12)) / 365 Total Interest Payable Sum of all the above charges ₹1124.38 (₹579.45 + ₹98.63 + ₹431.51 + ₹14.79) GST in applicable on interest charges GST is applicable on all fees, interest, surcharge and other charges ₹202.39 18% x 1124.38 Note: These illustrations are meant to be indicative and to show how interest is calculated and charged. Interest Free Period The interest free period could range from 13 to 47 days. Example for the calculation of interest free period: For a statement for the period from May 1, 2023 to May 31, 2023 the payment due date would be Jun 15, 2023. Assuming that the cardholder has paid the Total Amount Due of the previous month statement by the payment due date, the grace period would be: For a purchase dated May 2, 2023, the interest-free grace period is from May 2, 2023 to June 15, 2023, i.e. 45 days. For a purchase dated May 30, 2023, the interest-free grace period is from May 30, 2023 to June 15, 2023, i.e. 17 days. Thus, the grace period can vary depending upon the date of purchase. Note: If the Total Amount Due is not paid by the payment due date, then there will be no interest free period. There is an additional three day period (as mandated by the Reserve Bank India “ RBI ”) post the payment due date during which if the Cardholder makes a payment, they will not be charged late payment or interest charges. Forex Markup Fee If a transaction is made in a currency other than Indian Rupees, that transaction will be converted into Indian Rupees. The conversion will take place on the date the transaction is settled which may not be the same date on which the transaction was made. If the transaction is not in USD (US Dollars), the amount will first be converted to USD, and then the USD amount will be converted to INR as per the rate provided by VISA. On this amount, a forex markup fee will be levied, and GST will be applicable on the markup fee. If this transaction is reversed, both the markup fee and GST charges will be refunded. In case of a refund, however, only the transaction amount will be refunded in INR as per the conversion rate applicable on the date of refund. A forex markup fee will also be levied in case of an Indian Rupee (INR) transaction done at a merchant or payment gateway that is based out of India. Credit Limit Cardholder’s Credit Limit and cash limit will be communicated to them at the time of card issuance. This will also be mentioned in the monthly statements. Available credit limit is calculated by deducting the utilised limit from the Total Credit Limit. “Available Credit Limit” is the limit up to which a cardholder can make purchases. Cardholders may be entitled to apply for an enhancement of the Credit and/or Cash Limit after 12 months from the date of card issuance. Federal Bank also reserves the right to recommend a Credit Limit increase to the Cardholders based on their Edge Federal Bank Visa Credit Card usage, in the Jupiter app. This recommendation and its associated terms and conditions will be made available for the Cardholder to consider before accepting the recommendation. Once the Cardholder has read and agrees to the Terms related to Credit limit increase displayed inside the Jupiter app and provided their consent to increase the limit, their Credit Limit will be enhanced. Cardholder’s acceptance of the limit increase recommendation where they specifically validate the limit increase and agree to the terms will be treated as a consent. The Bank or its authorised third party service provider, will keep the digital records of such consent and will treat it as proof of consent in case of any dispute arising later on account of limit increase. The Federal Bank will review the Cardholder’s account periodically and reserve the right to decrease their credit limit based on their transaction patterns, payment behaviour and other internal criteria. This will be informed to the Cardholder via the Jupiter app and/or via email and SMS. Billing Payment Schedule The billing cycles have been illustrated based on examples below. Cycle Duration Statement Generation Date Payment Due Date 3 Day Grace Period Date from when interest shall be levied Late Payment Charges 1 st May - 31st May 1 st June 15 th June 16 th to 18 th June 16 th June Levied in next statement if minimum amount due is not paid by 18th of June (11:59 PM) 6 th May to 5 th June 6 th June 20 th June 21 st to 23 th June 21 th June Levied in next statement if minimum amount due is not paid by 23rd June (11:59 PM) 11 th May to 10 th June 11 th June 25 th June 26 th to 28 th June 26 th June Levied in next statement if minimum amount due is not paid by 28th June (11:59 PM) 19 th May to 18 th June 19 th June 3 rd July 4 th to 6 th July 4 th July Levied in next statement if minimum amount due is not paid by 6th July (11:59 PM) 21 st May to 20 th June 21 st June 5 th July 6 th to 8 th July 6 th July Levied in next statement if minimum amount due is not paid by 8th July (11:59 PM) 26 th May to 25 th June 26 th June 10 th July 11 th to 13 th July 11 th July Levied in next statement if minimum amount due is not paid by 13th July (11:59 PM) 2. Billing statements The Cardholder’s billing statement will be generated every month. It will contain a break-up of all purchases, payments, fees, interest charges, refunds and taxes. In case the card was not used in a month, the statement will mention there were no spends in that month. Jupiter App also has an option to view and download the statement in PDF format. The Cardholder will also be sent a PDF copy of their monthly statement on their registered email address. The Cardholder shall, however, review  the statement from time to time on Jupiter in order to stay updated on the statement. Only settled transactions will be included in the monthly statement. In case a transaction done in a particular cycle has not been settled by the time of statement generation, it will be included in the next cycle. As per the Network Partner guidelines, merchants are given up to a maximum of 10 days to settle domestic transactions and 15 days to settle international transactions. In case a transaction is not settled in this timeframe, the transaction amount will be refunded to the Cardholder. After this, in case of late presentment of the transaction for up to 45 days from date of transaction, they can be charged again and their available limit reduced accordingly. Any transactions on which a dispute has been raised, will not be included in the monthly statement. 3. Minimum Amount Due The Cardholder will need to pay at least the Minimum Amount Due by the Payment Due Date as indicated in the monthly statement. If they have paid the Minimum Amount Due, they will be liable to pay interest only on the outstanding amount and can continue to earn and redeem rewards. Minimum Amount Due stated in the monthly statement shall be calculated as per the following formula: 5% of the total amount due (reduced by any amount that has been credited and/ or refunded and/ or repaid by the Cardholder and/ or waived off by Jupiter before the payment due date) + EMI amount billed for the month + 100% of any fees, interest, charges and taxes If the minimum amount due is less than ₹500, the Cardholder will be charged ₹500 as the minimum amount due. If  the total amount due is less than ₹500 then the total amount due value becomes the minimum amount due. 4. Payment knock-off order: When the Cardholder makes a payment, it is adjusted in this order: Taxes Fees Interest Purchases Furthermore, purchase amounts are knocked off starting with the earliest transaction date. 5. How Refunds/Reversals/Waivers/Chargebacks impact the statement The Cardholder must pay for the transactions billed in the Edge Federal Bank Visa Credit Card statement to avoid any additional charges being levied. However, if they receive any incoming transactions (refunds, reversals, waivers or chargebacks) before having cleared the bill, these transactions will first offset the total amount due of the last statement. If there is no billed amount due, this amount will be adjusted against their current outstanding. If there are no outstanding dues on the card, we will adjust incoming transactions only up to ₹5000 or 1% of the Cardholder’s Credit Limit (whichever is lower), and any excess balance will be refunded to their specified bank account. 6. Method of payment The Cardholder can pay the outstanding dues from the Jupiter app using the following modes: Auto-debit from their Federal bank account. This auto-debit will be initiated at 10 AM on the payment due date Bank transfer from their Federal bank account or another other Registered Bank Account. UPI payments (up to ₹2 lakh) from any VPA added to the Jupiter App. Via debit card and net banking of any bank account using a unique payment link sent to the Cardholder via SMS and email. Federal Bank have the right to add/remove any methods of payment at any time. 7. Billing disputes resolution All the contents of the statement will be deemed to be correct and accepted if the Cardholder does not inform us of any discrepancies within 30 days of the statement generation date. In the event of billing disputes/discrepancies, we shall investigate and confirm the liability for such transactions. For any disputes which result in a chargeback being raised, we may offer a temporary credit during the period of investigation, which may be reversed along with applicable charges subject to outcome of the investigation. Any GST levied will not be reversed in any dispute on fees and charges or interest. 8.

QUALITY OF GOODS AND SERVICES The Bank and/ or Jupiter as authorized by the Bank shall not, in any way, be responsible for merchandise, merchandise warranty or services purchased, or availed by you from Merchant Establishments, including on account of delay in delivery, non-delivery, non-receipt of goods or receipt of defective goods by you. Edge-Federal Card is purely a facility to you to purchase goods and/or avail of services, and the Bank and/ or Jupiter holds out no warranty or makes no representation about quality, delivery or otherwise of the merchandise. Any dispute or claim regarding the merchandise or service must be resolved by you directly with the Merchant Establishment. The existence of the claim or dispute shall not relieve you of your obligation to pay all the Charges to the Bank and you agree to pay such charges promptly. CREDIT TRANSACTIONS A debit for a purchase and a subsequent credit for cancellation of goods / services are considered to be two separate transactions. You must pay for the purchase transaction as it appears in the Edge-Federal Card statement to avoid any additional charges being levied. On cancellation, the refund will only be credited to the Card Account (less cancellation charges) as and when received by Jupiter as authorized by the Bank. If the credit is not posted to the Card Account within a period of 30 days, you can notify Jupiter via email or phone. The cardholder must pay for the transactions billed in the Edge-Federal Card statement to avoid any additional charges being levied. However, if they receive any incoming transactions (refunds, reversals, waivers or chargebacks) before having cleared the bill, these transactions will first offset the total amount due of the last statement. If there is no billed amount due, this amount will be adjusted against their current outstanding. If there are no outstanding dues on the card, we will adjust incoming transactions only up to ₹5000 or 1% of the cardholder’s Credit Limit (whichever is lower), and any excess balance will be refunded to their specified bank account. TRANSACTIONS MADE IN FOREIGN COUNTRY/CURRENCY When using your Edge-Federal Card abroad, you agree to use it strictly in accordance with the relevant exchange control regulations, issued and as amended by RBI from time to time. In the event you exceed your entitlements as per the exchange control guidelines of RBI, you shall bring the same to the notice of Jupiter as authorized by the Bank via email. If the passport is required to be endorsed for any such charges incurred as stipulated by RBI, the onus of getting the passport endorsed shall lie entirely on the Cardholder.. In the event of any failure to comply with the prevailing exchange control guidelines issued by RBI, the Cardholder shall be liable for any action under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 as amended from time to time, and be debarred from the credit card facility either at the Bank’s and/ or Jupiter’s (as authorised by the Bank) instance or by RBI. The Bank and/ or Jupiter as authorized by the Bank shall be under no liability in respect of any loss or damage arising directly or indirectly out of decline of a charge because of exceeding foreign exchange entitlements as prescribed by RBI guidelines issued from time to time, on the Bank and/ or Jupiter as authorized by the Bank becoming aware of you exceeding your entitlements. If a transaction is made in a currency other than Indian Rupees, that transaction will be converted into Indian Rupees and shown in your Statement. The conversion will take place on the date the transaction is settled with the Bank, which may not be the same date on which the transaction was done. If the transaction is not in US Dollars (USD), the conversion will be made through US Dollars, by converting the charged amount into US Dollars and then by converting the US Dollar amount into Indian Rupees (INR), at the rate provided by VISA on the settlement date. On this amount, a forex markup fee will be levied. A forex markup fee will also be levied in case of an Indian Rupee (INR) transaction done at a merchant or payment gateway that is based out of India. ARBITRATION AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES Any requisition received from a Merchant Establishment by Jupiter as authorized by the Bank for payment shall be conclusive proof that the Charges were properly incurred by cardholders, unless the Edge-Federal Card is lost, stolen or fraudulently misused and the same is reported as provided in Clause VIII  above - which they would need to prove. Cardholder’s signature on any charges lips or authentication of the transaction by input of their Edge-Federal Card PIN, Jupiter App PIN, One-Time-Password (OTP) sent on their registered mobile number/email address or the gesture of swiping the transaction confirmation notification i.e. Swipe to Pay, or use of Visa Safe Click/One-Click process defined by Visa shall be conclusive evidence of the liability incurred by them. In case of any facility availed of through Customer Care or the Jupiter App by using the Edge-Federal Card PIN, Jupiter App PIN or Cardholder ID will be conclusive proof that the cardholder has affected the transaction. The Bank and/ or Jupiter as authorized by the Bank shall not be required to ensure that cardholders have received the purchased goods or services. In the event cardholders disagree with a Charge indicated in the Statement, please let Jupter know within 30 days of receipt of the Statement, failing which it would be assumed that all Charges indicated in the Statement are in order. All disputes, differences and / or claim or questions arising out of these presents, or in any way touching or concerning the same, or as to constructions, meaning or effect thereof, or as to the right, obligations and liabilities of the parties hereunder shall be referred to and settled by arbitration, to be held in accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, or any statutory amendments thereof, of a sole arbitrator jointly appointed by you and Jupiter, and in the event of death, unwillingness, refusal, neglect, inability or incapability of a person so appointed to act as an arbitrator, the parties shall collectively on good faith basis appoint another arbitrator. The arbitrator shall not be required to give any reasons for the award, and the award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties concerned.

In case Cardholder’s  credit limit is breached due to a higher amount presented by the merchant at the time of  settlement, there will be no charges levied. *** Users to be eligible for 1% (Maximum Rs.100/-) Fuel Surcharge Waiver upon spend of  minimum Rs.400/- and maximum spend of Rs.3,000/- exclusive of GST and other charges. Withdrawal Limits Your Credit Limit will be communicated to you at the time of card issuance. These limits will  be mentioned in your monthly statements. Available credit limit is calculated by deducting the utilised limit from the Total Credit Limit.  “Available Credit Limit” is the limit up to which you can make purchases or withdraw cash  from an ATM respectively. Cash limit is a subset of your credit limit i.e. up to 20% of your Credit Limit and is assigned  based on your usage patterns, payment behavior and credit history. It will only be activated  after 180 days from the date of issuance of the Edge+-CSB Bank RuPay Credit Card. After this 180 day period, your cash limit will be made available at the sole discretion and on such  terms as may be communicated by CSB Bank from time-to-time. Billing Statement Your billing statement will be generated every month and sent to your registered email  address (Refer to the MITC or Jupiter App for the exact dates based on your Billing cycle) It  will contain a break-up of all fees, purchases, interest charges, repayments, refunds and  taxes. In case the card was not used during the billing cycle, the billing statement will  mention there were no spends in that month. Minimum Amount Due When you receive your Edge+ CSB Bank RuPay Credit Card statement, you can choose to  pay the total amount due or the Minimum Amount Due. Minimum Amount Due stated in  the monthly statement shall be calculated as per the following formula: 5% of the total amount due + EMI amount billed for the month + 100% of any fees, interest, charges and taxes If the minimum amount due is less than Rs. 500, you’ll be charged Rs. 500 as the minimum  amount due. If the total amount due is less than Rs. 500, then the total amount due value  becomes the minimum amount due. The Minimum Amount Due should be paid before the Payment Due Date. The remaining  balance can be carried forward to subsequent months. Note, that paying the minimum  amount due would still incur you finance charges on the unpaid bill amount. Method of payment You can pay the outstanding dues from the mobile app using the following modes: Auto-debit from your bank account Bank transfer from your bank account UPI payments (up to Rs. 2 lakh or any other such amounts prescribed from time to time)  from any virtual payment account added to the Jupiter App. Via debit card and net banking through any bank account using a unique payment link sent  to you via SMS and email CSB Bank has the right to add/remove any methods of payment at any time. Interest-Free (grace) period Interest-free period, from the start of the billing cycle date, shall be 13 - 47 days  (depending on the date of the transaction). However, the interest-free period will not be  available if you fail to pay the total amount due of the previous month. The payment due date for the Edge+-CSB Bank RuPay Credit Card comes at least 14 days after the  Statement Generation Date (Please check your statement for your exact Payment Due  Date). Therefore, the interest free credit period can range from 13 - 47 days depending on  the date of your credit card transaction. Illustrative Example for Interest-Free Period Calculation For a statement for the period from May 1, 2025 to May 30, 2025 the payment due date  would be Jun 15, 2025.Assuming that you have paid the Total Amount Due of the previous  month statement by the payment due date, the grace period would be: For a purchase dated May 2, 2025, the interest-free grace period is from May 2, 2025 to  June 15, 2025, i.e. 45 days. For a purchase dated May 30, 2025, the interest-free grace period is from May 30, 2025 to  June 15, 2025, i.e. 17 days. Thus, the grace period can vary depending upon the date of purchase. Note: 1. If the Total Amount Due is not paid by the payment due date, then there will be no  interest free period. 2. For cash advances, interest is charged from the date of the transaction until the date  of payment. 3. There is an additional three day period (as mandated by the Reserve Bank of India  (“ RBI ”) post the payment due date during which if you make a repayment, it is  considered a timely repayment. Illustration of Interest Charges 1. Interest will be charged if the Total Amount Due (“ TAD ”) is not paid by the payment  due date. Interest will be charged on the outstanding amount due and on all new  transactions (from the transaction date) till such time as the total amount due is paid  in full. 2. Additionally, interest will be levied on all cash advances from the date of the  transaction until the date of payment. The following example shows how interest is calculated. In the table given below, it has been  assumed that the TAD of the previous month’s statement has been paid by the payment due date and there is no outstanding amount. The statement generation date is the 1st. Given  these assumptions, interest will be calculated as shown: Date Details 2 March, 2025 Transaction of ₹10,000 1 April, 2025 Statement generated Total Amount Due: ₹10,000 Minimum Amount Due: ₹ 500 15 April, 2025 Payment due Total Amount Due: ₹10,000 Minimum Amount Due: ₹ 500 21 April 2025 Payment of ₹2000 made 22 April, 2025 Transaction of ₹1000 On statement dated 1 May 2025 , the following interest charges will be levied. Interest is  calculated using the following formula: Outstanding transaction amount * Number of days since transaction * (Interest rate x 12  months) / 365 Details Reason Amount Calculation Interest on ₹10,000  for 50 days (from Mar 2 to Apr 20) Interest on entire transaction amount  from transaction date  till the date of payment ₹616.44 (10000 x 50 x (3.75%  x12)) / 365 Interest on ₹8,000 for  10 days (from Apr 21  to Apr 30) Interest on outstanding  transaction amount  from the date of ₹98.63 (8000 x 10 x (3.75% x 12))  / 365 payment till the next  statement date Interest on ₹1,000 for  9 days (from Apr 22  to Apr 30) Since TAD has not been  paid, interest free period doesn’t apply on  this transaction Interest on entire transaction amount till  the next statement date ₹11.09 (1000 x 9 x (3.75% x  12)) / 365 Total Interest Payable Sum of all the above  charges ₹726.16 (₹616.44+₹98.63+₹11.0 9) GST is applicable on  interest charges GST is applicable on all  fees, interest, surcharge  and other charges ₹130.71 18% x ₹726.16 Total Payable (Interest + GST) ₹856.87 ₹726.16 + ₹130.71 Note: These illustrations are meant to be indicative and to show how interest is calculated  and charged.

GST and applicable taxes shall be applicable, in addition to the rates mentioned above Late Payment Fee Late payment Fee will be applicable if the Minimum Amount Due (“MAD”) is not paid by the  payment due date. Illustrative example for calculation of Late Payment Fee: In the example below, consider the billing cycle is 1st of the calendar month - end of the  month. Statements are generated on the 1st and are due on the 15th of every month. There  is no principal outstanding at the start of the following cycle. Date Details 2 March, 2025 Transaction of ₹10,000 1 April, 2025 Statement generated. ● Principal Amount Due: ₹10,000 ● Minimum Amount Due: ₹500 15 April, 2025 Payment due ● Principal Amount Due: ₹10,000 ● Minimum Amount Due: ₹500 21 April, 2025 Payment of ₹2,000 made 1 May, 2025 Late payment fee of ₹500 applied 1 May, 2025 GST of ₹90 on the Late Payment Fee added to bill Interest Charges: 1. Interest will be charged if the Total Amount Due (“TAD”) is not paid by the payment due  date. Interest will be charged on the principal outstanding amount due and on all new  transactions (from the transaction date) till such time as the total amount due is paid in full. 2. The following example shows how interest is calculated. In the table given below, it has  been assumed that the Total Amount Due (“TAD”) of the previous month’s statement has  been paid by the payment due date and there is no outstanding amount. The statement  generation date is the 1st. Given these assumptions, interest will be calculated as shown: Date Details 2 March, 2025 Transaction of ₹10,000 1 April, 2025 Statement generated. ● Principal Amount Due: ₹10,000 ● Minimum Amount Due: ₹500 15 April, 2025 Payment due ● Principal Amount Due: ₹10,000 ● Minimum Amount Due: ₹500 21 April, 2025 Payment of ₹2,000 made 22 April, 2025 Transaction of ₹1,000 4. On statement dated 1 May 2025, the following interest charges will be levied. Interest is  calculated using the following formula: Principal Outstanding transaction amount * Number of days since transaction * (Interest  rate x 12 months) / 365 Details Reason Amount Calculation Interest on ₹10,000 for 50  days (from Mar 2 to Apr 20) Interest on entire transaction amount  from transaction date  till the date of payment ₹616.44 (10000 x 50 x (3.75% x12)) / 365 Interest on ₹8,000 for 10  days (from Apr  21 to Apr 30) Interest on outstanding  transaction amount  from the date of payment till the next  statement date ₹98.63 (8000 x 10 x (3.75% x 12)) / 365 Interest on ₹1,000 for 9 days (from Apr  22 to Apr 30) Since TAD has not been  paid, interest free period doesn’t apply on  this transaction Interest on entire transaction amount till  the next statement date ₹11.09 (1000 x 9 x (3.75% x 12)) /  365 Total Interest  Payable Sum of all the above  charges ₹726.16 (₹616.44+₹98.63+₹11.09) GST is applicable on  interest charges GST is applicable on all  fees, interest, surcharge and other  charges ₹130.71 18% x ₹726.16 Total Payable  (Interest + GST) ₹856.87 ₹726.16 + ₹130.71 Note: These illustrations are meant to be indicative and to show how interest is calculated  and charged. Cash Advance Cardholders cannot use the Edge CSB Bank Credit Card and Edge+ CSB Bank CreditCard to withdraw cash from ATMs in India and/or overseas. Interest Free Period The interest free period could range from 13 to 47 days. Example for the calculation of interest free period: For a statement for the period from May  1, 2025to May 31, 2025 the payment due date would be Jun 15, 2025. Assuming that the cardholder has paid the Total Amount Due of the previous month statement by the  payment due date, the grace period would be: 1. For a purchase dated May 2, 2025, the interest-free grace period is from May 2, 2025  to June 15, 2025, i.e. 45 days. 2. For a purchase dated May 30, 2024, the interest-free grace period is from May 30, 2025  to June 15, 2025, i.e. 17 days. Thus, the grace period can vary depending upon the date of purchase. Note: If the Total  Amount Due is not paid by the payment due date, then there will be no interest free period.  For cash advances, interest is charged from the date of the transaction until the date of  payment. There is an additional three-day period (as mandated by the Reserve Bank India  “RBI”) post the payment due date during which if the Cardholder makes a payment, they  will not be charged late payment or interest charges. Forex Markup Fee If a transaction is made in a currency other than Indian Rupees, that transaction will be  converted into Indian Rupees. The conversion will take place on the date the transaction is settled which may not be the  same date on which the transaction was made. If the transaction is not in USD (US  Dollars), the amount will first be converted to USD, and then the USD amount will be  converted to INR as per the rate provided by international network partners of RuPay. On  this amount, a forex markup fee will be levied, and GST will be applicable on the markup  fee. If this transaction is reversed, both the markup fee and GST charges will be refunded. In  case of a refund, however, only the transaction amount will be refunded in INR as per the  conversion rate applicable on the date of refund. A forex markup fee will also be levied in case of an Indian Rupee (INR) transaction done at a  merchant or payment gateway that is based out of India. Credit Limit Cardholder’s Credit Limit will be communicated to them at the time of card issuance. This  will also be mentioned in the monthly statements. Available credit limit is calculated by  deducting the utilized limit from the Total Credit Limit. “Available Credit Limit” is the limit up  to which a cardholder can make purchases. Cardholders may be entitled to apply for an enhancement of the Credit Limit after 12  months from the date of card issuance. CSB Bank also reserves the right to recommend a  Credit Limit increase to the Cardholders based on their Edge CSB Bank Credit Card and  Edge+ CSB Bank Credit Card usage, in the Jupiter app. This recommendation and its  associated terms and conditions will be made available for the Cardholder to consider  before accepting the recommendation. Once the Cardholder has read and agrees to the Terms related to Credit Limit increase  displayed inside the Jupiter app and provided their consent to increase the limit, their  Credit Limit will be enhanced. Cardholder’s acceptance of the limit increase  recommendation where they specifically validate the limit increase and agree to the terms  will be treated as a consent. The Bank or its authorized third party service provider, will  keep the digital records of such consent and will treat it as proof of consent in case of any  dispute arising later on account of limit increase. CSB Bank will review the Cardholder’s account periodically and reserve the right to  decrease their credit limit based on their transaction patterns, payment behavior and other  internal criteria. This will be informed to the Cardholder via the Jupiter app and/or via email  and SMS. Billing 1. Payment Schedule The billing cycles have been illustrated based on examples below Cycle Duration Statement Generatio n Date Payment Due Date 3 Day Grace Period Date from when interest shall be levied Late Payment Fee 7 th May - 6 th Jun 6 th Jun 21 st Jun 22 nd to 24 th Jun 22 nd Jun Levied in next statement if minimum amount due is not paid by 24th of Jun (11:59 PM) 17 th May to 16 th Jun 16 th Jun 1 st Jul 2 nd to 4 th Jul 2 nd Jul Levied in next statement if minimum amount due is not paid by 4th Jul (11:59 PM) 27 th May to 26 th Jun 26 th Jun 11 th Jul 12 th to 14 th Jul 12 th Jul Levied in next statement if minimum amount due is not paid by 14th Jul (11:59 PM) 2. Billing statements The Cardholder’s billing statement will be generated every month. It will contain a break-up  of all purchases, payments, fees, interest charges, refunds and taxes. In case the card was not used in a month, the statement will mention there were no spends  in that month. Jupiter App also has an option to view and download the statement in PDF  format. The Cardholder will also be sent a PDF copy of their monthly statement to their  registered email address. The Cardholder shall, however, review the statement from time to  time on Jupiter app in order to stay updated on the statement. Only settled transactions will be included in the monthly statement. In case a transaction  done in a particular cycle has not been settled by the time of statement generation, it will be  included in the next cycle. As per the Network Partner guidelines, merchants are given up to  a maximum of 10 days to settle domestic transactions and 15 days to settle international  transactions. In case a transaction is not settled in this timeframe, the transaction amount will be  refunded to the Cardholder. After this, in case of late presentment of the transaction for up  to 45 days from date of transaction, they can be charged again and their available limit  reduced accordingly. Any transactions on which a dispute has been raised, will not be included in the monthly  statement. 3. Minimum Amount Due The Cardholder will need to pay at least the Minimum Amount Due by the Payment Due Date  as indicated in the monthly statement. If they have paid the Minimum Amount Due, they will  be liable to pay interest only on the outstanding amount and can continue to earn and  redeem rewards. Minimum Amount Due stated in the monthly statement shall be calculated as per the  following formula: 5% of the total amount due (reduced by any amount that has been credited and/ or refunded  and/ or repaid by the Cardholder and/ or waived off by Bank before the payment due date) + EMI amount billed for the month + 100% of any fees, interest, charges and taxes If the minimum amount due is less than ₹500, the Cardholder will be charged ₹500 as the  minimum amount due. If the total amount due is less than ₹500 then the total amount due  value becomes the minimum amount due. Note- Making only the minimum payment every month would result in the repayment  stretching over months / years with consequential compounded interest payment on your  outstanding balance. 4. Payment knock-off order: When the Cardholder makes a payment, it is adjusted in this order: - Taxes - Fees - Interest - Purchases Furthermore, purchase amounts are knocked off starting with the earliest transaction date. 5. How Refunds/Reversals/Waivers/Chargebacks impact the statement The Cardholder must pay for the transactions billed in the Edge+ CSB Bank Credit Card  statement to avoid any additional charges being levied. However, if they receive any  incoming transactions (refunds, reversals, waivers or chargebacks) before having cleared  the bill, these transactions will first offset the total amount due on the last statement. If there is no billed amount due, this amount will be adjusted against their current  outstanding. If there are no outstanding dues on the card, we will adjust incoming  transactions only up to Rs. 5000 or 1% of the Cardholder’s Credit Limit (whichever is lower),  and any excess balance will be refunded to their specified bank account. 6. Method of payment The Cardholder can pay the outstanding dues from the Jupiter app using the following  modes: - Bank transfer from their bank account on Jupiter App or other Registered Bank Account. - UPI payments (up to ₹2 lakh) from any Bank Account added to the Jupiter UPI App. - Via debit card and net banking of any bank account using a unique payment link sent to the  Cardholder via SMS and email. - CSB Bank has the right to add/remove any methods of payment at any time. 7. Billing disputes resolution All the contents of the statement will be deemed to be correct and accepted if the  Cardholder does not inform us of any discrepancies within 30 days of the statement’s  generation date. In the event of billing disputes/discrepancies, we shall investigate and  confirm the liability for such transactions. For any disputes which result in a chargeback being raised, we may offer a temporary credit  during the period of investigation, which may be reversed along with applicable charges  subject to outcome of the investigation.

You will continue to receive communications about transactions and core features  of the Credit Card. 6. When requested by the Bank or Jupiter, the Cardholder shall provide any  information, records or certificates relating to any matters that the Bank deems  necessary. The Cardholder will also authorise the Bank, to verify the information  furnished by whatever means or from whichever source the Bank deems necessary.  If the data is not provided or incorrect data is provided, the Bank, at its discretion,  may refuse renewal of the card or cancel the card forthwith and demand payment  of all outstanding on the Credit Card account immediately 7. The Cardholder hereby acknowledge and consents to the Bank's absolute  entitlement and full authority to, at its discretion, sell, transfer, or assign any or all  outstanding balances on the Edge+ CSB Bank Credit account to a third party  chosen by the Bank. The Cardholder further acknowledges that upon receiving  notice from the Bank regarding such action, they are obligated to accept the  designated third party as the new creditor and to remit any outstanding dues  directly to this third party. This action relieves the Cardholder of any corresponding  obligation to the Bank. All associated costs related to this process shall be charged  to the Cardholder Edge+ CSB Bank Credit Card account. 8. In the event that the Cardholder fails to make payment of the Minimum Amount Due  (MAD), it is important to note that their name may be susceptible to inclusion in a  defaulters database. This database may be shared with other lending institutions and Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited (CIBIL), or potentially any other  relevant agency. It is within the Bank's prerogative to exercise this right. 9. The Bank retains the authority to reveal Cardholder information to any court with  appropriate jurisdiction, quasi-judicial bodies, law enforcement agencies, or any  other division of the Central Government, State Government, or the Reserve Bank of  India. 10. The Bank does not assume responsibility or liability for instances where a Merchant  Establishment declines to accept the card, regardless of the cause. Nevertheless,  any instances of refusal by a Merchant Establishment or a Bank can be reported to  the Bank. Providing information such as the transaction location, date, time, and  any relevant details will assist the Bank should it choose, at its discretion, to initiate  any investigations. QUALITY OF GOODS AND SERVICES 1. The Bank/Jupiter shall not, in any way, be responsible for merchandise,  merchandise warranty or services purchased, or availed by you from Merchant  Establishments, including on account of delay in delivery, non-delivery, non-receipt  of goods or receipt of defective goods by you. 2. Edge+ CSB Bank Credit is purely a facility to you to purchase goods and/or avail of  services, and the Bank and/ or Jupiter holds out no warranty or makes no  representation about quality, delivery or otherwise of the merchandise. 3. Any dispute or claim regarding the merchandise or service must be resolved by you  directly with the Merchant Establishment. The existence of the claim or dispute  shall not relieve you of your obligation to pay all the Charges to the Bank and you  agree to pay such charges promptly. CREDIT TRANSACTIONS 1. A debit for a purchase and a subsequent credit for cancellation of goods / services  are considered to be two separate transactions. You must pay for the purchase  transaction as it appears in the Edge+ CSB Bank Credit statement to avoid any  additional charges being levied. 2. On cancellation, the refund will only be credited to the Card Account (less  cancellation charges) as and when received by Jupiter as authorized by the Bank. If  the credit is not posted to the Card Account within a period of 30 days, you can  notify Jupiter via email or phone. 3. The cardholder must pay for the transactions billed in the Edge+ CSB Bank Credit statement to avoid any additional charges being levied. However, if they receive any  incoming transactions (refunds, reversals, waivers or chargebacks) before having  cleared the bill, these transactions will first offset the total amount due of the last  statement. 4. If there is no billed amount due, this amount will be adjusted against their current  outstanding. If there are no outstanding dues on the card, we will adjust incoming  transactions only up to ₹5000 or 1% of the cardholder’s Credit Limit (whichever is  lower), and any excess balance will be refunded to their specified bank account. TRANSACTIONS MADE IN FOREIGN COUNTRY/CURRENCY 1. When using your Edge+ CSB Bank Credit abroad, you agree to use it strictly in  accordance with the relevant exchange control regulations, issued and as amended  by competent Government authorities and by RBI from time to time. 2. In the event you exceed your entitlements as per the exchange control guidelines of  RBI, you shall bring the same to the notice of Jupiter as authorized by the Bank via  email. If the passport is required to be endorsed for any such charges incurred as  stipulated by RBI, the onus of getting the passport endorsed shall lie entirely on the  Cardholder. 3. In the event of any failure to comply with the prevailing exchange control guidelines  issued by RBI, the Cardholder shall be liable for any action under the Foreign  Exchange Management Act, 1999 as amended from time to time, and be debarred  from the credit card facility either at the Bank’s and/ or Jupiter’s (as authorised by  the Bank) instance or by RBI. 4. The Bank and/ or Jupiter as authorized by the Bank shall be under no liability in  respect of any loss or damage arising directly or indirectly out of decline of a charge  because of exceeding foreign exchange entitlements as prescribed by RBI guidelines issued from time to time, on the Bank and/ or Jupiter as authorized by the  Bank becoming aware of you exceeding your entitlements. 5. If a transaction is made in a currency other than Indian Rupees, that transaction will  be converted into Indian Rupees and shown in your Statement. The conversion will  take place on the date the transaction is settled with the Bank, which may not be  the same date on which the transaction was done. 6. If the transaction is not in US Dollars (USD), the conversion will be made through US  Dollars, by converting the charged amount into US Dollars and then by converting  the US Dollar amount into Indian Rupees (INR), at the rate provided by RuPAY on the  settlement date. On this amount, a forex markup fee will be levied. 7. A forex markup fee plus applicable taxes will also be levied in case of an Indian  Rupee (INR) transaction done at a merchant or payment gateway that is based out  of India. ARBITRATION AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES 1. Any requisition received from a Merchant Establishment by Jupiter as authorized by  the Bank for payment shall be conclusive proof that the Charges were properly  incurred by cardholders, unless the Edge+ CSB Bank Credit is lost, stolen or  fraudulently misused and the same is reported as provided in “BLOCK / FREEZE/  SLEEP MODE” above - which they would need to prove. 2. Cardholder’s signature on any charges, slips or authentication of the transaction by  input of their Edge+ CSB Bank Credit PIN, UPI PIN, Jupiter App PIN, One-Time Password (OTP) sent on their registered mobile number/email address or the  gesture of swiping the transaction confirmation notification. 3. In case of any facility availed of through Customer Care or the Jupiter App by using  the Edge+ CSB Bank Card PIN, Jupiter App PIN or Cardholder ID will be conclusive  proof that the cardholder has affected the transaction. The Bank and/ or Jupiter as  authorized by the Bank shall not be required to ensure that cardholders have received the purchased goods or services. 4. In the event cardholders disagree with a Charge indicated in the Statement, please  let Jupiter/Bank know within 30 days of receipt of the Statement, failing which it  would be assumed that all Charges indicated in the Statement are in order. 5. All disputes, differences and / or claim or questions arising out of these presents, or  in any way touching or concerning the same, or as to constructions, meaning or  effect thereof, or as to the right, obligations and liabilities of the parties hereunder  shall be referred to and settled by arbitration, to be held in accordance with the  provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, or any statutory amendments thereof, of a sole arbitrator jointly appointed by you and Jupiter, and in  the event of death, unwillingness, refusal, neglect, inability or incapability of a  person so appointed to act as an arbitrator, the parties shall collectively on good  faith basis appoint another arbitrator. The arbitrator shall not be required to give any  reasons for the award, and the award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on  all parties concerned. The arbitration proceedings shall be held in Mumbai. SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES All disputes are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts in Mumbai,  India, and shall be governed by the laws of India. Any arbitration proceeding hereunder shall  be conducted on a confidential basis. Each Party shall cooperate in good faith to expedite  (to the maximum extent practicable) the conduct of any arbitral proceedings commenced. The future of financial wellness starts here.

It is similar to a regular FD, but for senior citizens. The senior citizen FD offers additional interest of up to 0.5%. Moreover, it also pays regular interest and acts as a source of income during retirement. Features of Senior Citizen Fixed Deposits Minimum and maximum deposit: The minimum and maximum deposit amount varies from bank to bank. However, some banks accept a minimum of Rs 100 from depositors for RBI fixed deposit scheme for senior citizens. There is no limit on the maximum amount of investment. Tenure: The tenure for senior citizen FDs is similar to regular FDs and varies between seven days to ten years. Interest: The interest on senior citizen FDs is slightly higher by 0.5% than regular FDs. Interest payout: The depositors can choose the interest payment frequency. The banks offer different frequencies such as monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, yearly, or at the time of maturity. By opting for regular interest, senior citizens can earn some income which will help them cover their expenses. Alternatively, by opting for getting the interest at the time of maturity, you can benefit from compounding. Nomination facility: Senior citizen FDs have a nomination facility, so there is no difficulty while claiming the FD amount. Premature withdrawals: Senior citizen FDs qualify for premature withdrawals. Hence in case of an emergency, you can withdraw your FD. However, it comes with a penalty on interest. Loan against FDs: Instead of withdrawing the FD prematurely, you can take a loan against the FD. Senior citizens can get loans at better rates than regular FDs. Automatic renewals: Banks automatically renew the FDs for the same tenure if you don't mention anything when opening the FD. The auto-renewal comes in handy when you don't need money immediately at the time of maturity.

The amount would be subtracted from their overall gross income to determine the individual's taxable income. The Income Tax Act's Section 80C authorizes this deduction. The following requirements must be met to claim this deduction: Only those who are members of Hindu United Families (or HUF) and individuals are permitted to invest in fixed deposit plans that offer tax benefits. The minimum amount that the bank specifies for the Fixed Deposit is permissible. The 5-year lock-in term applies to the tax-saving fixed deposits. Loans and premature withdrawals from the fixed deposit are prohibited. People may invest in such Fixed Deposits through any commercial or public sector bank. Cooperative and rural banks cannot enjoy these benefits. Section 80C of the Income Tax Act of 1961 permits deductions for Post Office Time Deposits with terms of five years. Transfers between post offices are permitted for Post Office Fixed Deposits. Fixed Deposits may be held sporadically or collectively. The initial holder of the joint fixed deposit will receive the tax benefit in this scenario. Tax Deductible at Source (TDS) would be applicable since the interest earned on such Fixed Deposits is taxable according to the investor's tax bracket. The investment will pay interest monthly or quarterly, and this interest could be reinvested. There is a nomination provision for Tax Deductible Fixed Deposits. On these Fixed Deposits, banks give senior citizens comparatively greater interest rates. For Fixed Deposits with Tax Savings, there is a higher interest rate. How to avoid TDS on fixed deposits? All interest income produced in India, including interest from FDs, is subject to Tax Deducted at Source (or TDS). If the account holder or FD  applicant’s interest income for any financial year exceeds Rs. 10,000, they are legally required to pay tax. However, the account holder would not be required to pay tax if the earned interest is lower than Rs. 10,000. The following are some of the factors that one needs to be aware of to avoid TDS on fixed deposits: Self-declaration: Please file form 15G or 15H, as appropriate, if the combined amount of taxable income produced in the financial year and the interest gained from FDs does not exceed the allowed taxable limit. Which form to fill out: Form 15H would be for senior citizens, whereas Form 15G is intended for the general public. The applicant must be an Indian citizen aged 60 years or younger whose income does not exceed the applicable tax threshold. Only Indian residents over the age of 60 and those whose income is below the specified tax threshold may complete Form 15H. Managing your investments better: Investing can be done so long as it doesn't cost more than Rs. 10,000 each year. For instance, the financial year could be split in half by investing in a one-year fixed-rate bond in October. You can avoid paying TDS upon your investment because the fiscal year ends on March 31. Waiving off of TDS for the second applicant: Upon the primary account holder's death, the second account holder (or the second applicant) can operate the joint account.TDS will be automatically withheld from your account when you are the former applicant for a joint FD and your interest income is in excess of the permitted amount. TDS is not likely to be taken out of a joint account if you are the subsequent applicant. Distribution of investments: Instead of placing all of their money in one bank, investors can spread their investments over several banks. PAN: For your FD investment, the bank must receive your PAN information. Banks typically charge TDS at a greater rate of 20% if you don't provide your PAN information. Late submissions: The Income Tax authorities would issue a refund if the account holder files tax returns even though you failed to submit the necessary self-declaration forms and the TDS was deducted. However, you will be required to wait until July of the following year, and it will take a few more months for the reimbursement to be finalised. Conclusion Due to their assured returns and lack of financial risk, FDs continue to rank among the most popular investment options. Instead of paying high taxes, taking all required measures to undertake tax planning and managing your money more effectively is crucial. In addition to the techniques previously described, if one makes further investments, one may be able to claim tax exemption, which will assist lessen the tax overburden on the person to some extent.

It links an individual's biometric and demographic information to create a unified identity system used for government services, financial inclusion, and digital authentication. In this article, you'll learn what Aadhaar means, how it works, how to apply for one, and why it plays such a crucial role in everyday life, from LPG subsidies to SIM card activation.

This means you can’t withdraw, deposit, or transfer money until the issue is resolved. This action is typically initiated in response to legal orders, suspicious activity, or regulatory requirements. In simple terms, your account is locked — and any financial transactions are blocked until the freeze is lifted. Example: If your account is frozen due to suspected fraud, even automatic payments like EMIs or bill payments won’t go through. 'Account seized' is somewhat a similar term. 'Account seizure' is when authorities order a bank to freeze or take control of an account, usually over unpaid loans/ fees or suspected illegal activity, blocking the account holder from using the money in the account. Note: All account seizures involve a freeze, but not all account freezes lead to seizure. ‘Account Freeze' meaning in some of the Indian languages Language Explanation Hindi खाता फ्रीज होने का मतलब है कि खाते में किसी भी लेन-देन पर रोक लगाना। Marathi खाता फ्रीज म्हणजे खात्यावर कोणत्याही व्यवहारावर बंदी घालणे.

This daily cap depends on your bank, card type, and whether you're using your own bank's ATM or another bank's (on-us vs off-us). In this article, we’ll explain what ATM withdrawal limits are, how they vary by bank, what the latest RBI and bank rules say, and how to avoid extra charges. What Is an ATM Withdrawal Limit? ATM withdrawal limit refers to the highest amount you can withdraw in cash from an ATM in a day, month, or single transaction. These limits are set to ensure cash availability, reduce fraud risk, and maintain compliance with banking regulations. For example, if your daily limit is ₹25,000, you can’t withdraw more than that amount from any ATM in 24 hours, even if you have a ₹1 lakh balance. ‘ATM Withdrawal Limit’ in some of the Indian Languages Language Translation Explanation in Context Hindi एटीएम निकासी सीमा वह अधिकतम राशि जो आप एक दिन में एटीएम से निकाल सकते हैं। Marathi एटीएम पैसे काढण्याची मर्यादा एका दिवसात किंवा व्यवहारात एटीएममधून काढता येणारी कमाल रक्कम.

How to explain ‘ATM Withdrawal Limit’ to kids? Think of ATM withdrawal limits like your bank setting a daily "pocket money" rule. You can only take out a fixed amount, say, ₹25,000 per day. If you try to take more, the machine won’t let you. Also, if you use other bank ATMs too many times, you’ll be charged a small fee. It’s like your bank giving you a prepaid plan on how many times you can withdraw before they start billing extra. Types of ATM Limits: Daily, Transaction-wise & Monthly ATM withdrawal restrictions can be categorized into: Daily limit : Most commonly imposed limit, ranges between ₹10,000 and ₹1,00,000.

Beyond this limit : ₹23 + GST per extra transaction is usually charged. For example: "After five free withdrawals in metro cities, you'll be charged ₹23 + GST per ATM transaction." Fascinating Fact #2: UPI-ATM (Interoperable Cardless Cash Withdrawal) service allows transactions up to ₹10,000 per transaction , which forms part of the existing UPI per day limit set by issuer banks. This innovative service enables cardless cash withdrawals using UPI, bridging the gap between digital payments and physical cash access. Cash Withdrawal Limits for Credit Cards You can withdraw cash using a credit card , but it's usually expensive. Most banks allow 20–40% of your credit limit as a cash advance . Interest is charged from day one . There’s usually a cash withdrawal fee (e.g., 2.5% of the amount or ₹500, whichever is higher). No grace period or reward points apply. Can You Withdraw Cash Using a Credit Card? Yes, but it’s better avoided unless urgent. You're charged both interest and withdrawal fees , and these add up quickly. New RBI Guidelines and Bank Rules on Cash Withdrawal The RBI has not changed daily ATM withdrawal caps , but encourages: Reasonable capping on free transactions . Transparency on ATM charges . Standard ₹10,000–₹25,000 per transaction for most customers, unless a higher tier is availed. Difference Between On-Us vs Off-Us ATM Transactions On-Us : Transactions at your bank’s ATM (e.g., if you have an SBI Card and do ATM transactions at SBI ATM) Off-Us : Transactions at another bank’s ATM (e.g.,if you have an SBI Card and do ATM transactions at HDFC or any other bank’s ATM) Limits and charges often vary between these.

You know when you sign up for an app or online game, and sometimes you have to pay every month or every year to keep using it? Most credit cards work a bit like that: you pay a yearly fee just to have the card, even if you don’t use it. A lifetime free credit card is a special kind of credit card because you never pay that yearly fee, not when you first get it, and not in the future. You can keep using the card for as long as you want, and the bank won’t charge you any “membership” or “annual” fees. Example: Imagine you have a gaming card for your local cyber cafe or game zone. You can check out all kinds of games and consoles without paying to keep your card active each year. You only pay for the games you play. That's similar to a "lifetime free" card, it's always there for you, free to have, while you only get charged for how you use it (like buying something you can't pay back on time or taking out cash). Are Lifetime Free Credit Cards Really Free? Yes, in terms of annual or renewal fees . Once approved, you don’t have to worry about recurring yearly charges. However, it’s important to understand what charges still apply . What Charges Still Apply? Interest charges if you don’t pay your dues on time Late payment penalties Cash withdrawal fees GST and forex markup (usually 3.5% or more on international spends So, while there is no maintenance fee , the card isn't completely “free” if used recklessly. How to explain ‘Lifetime Free Credit Card’ to small kids? Imagine a game card of a cyber cafe or a gaming shop that never charges you a membership fee, no matter how long you stay. That’s what a lifetime free credit card is. You get the benefits of using ‘credit’ without paying every month or year. But if you delay payments for the game playing balance, the card still charges interest on your cards . It's perfect for people who want to have ‘gaming hours’  without ongoing costs,  as long as you use it wisely. How to Check If Your Credit Card Is Lifetime Free To confirm the lifetime free status of your credit card: Check the welcome kit or onboarding email Read the terms and conditions under the "Fees and Charges" section Contact customer care and ask for confirmation Minimum Income or CIBIL Requirements While LTF cards are often marketed as entry-level , you may still need: A minimum monthly income (₹15,000–₹25,000 depending on the bank) A decent CIBIL score (usually above 700) Basic KYC documentation Fascinating Facts #2: Currently the users can link their RuPay Credit Card on the mentioned UPI Apps: Jupiter, BHIM, PhonePe, GPay, PayZapp, and many more ( totaling over 55+ apps) , making lifetime free RuPay credit cards incredibly versatile for Indian digital payment habits.

Meaning, Risks & FAQs By Jupiter Team · July 23, 2025 · 4 min read IN THIS ARTICLE Your credit card statement often shows two amounts: Total Amount Due and Minimum Amount Due . While the minimum due may seem like a small, manageable payment, relying on it regularly can lead to long-term financial stress. This article explains what a credit card minimum amount due means, how it’s calculated, the consequences of paying only the minimum, and how to manage it smartly. What Does “Minimum Amount Due” Mean on a Credit Card? The minimum amount due is the smallest sum you must pay by the due date to keep your credit card account in good standing and avoid late payment fees. It’s usually 5% of the total outstanding balance , but it also includes any EMIs , past dues , and other charges . EMI + Outstanding Balance + Charges = Minimum Due Your statement’s minimum due is not a random figure. It’s calculated as: A percentage of your new outstanding balance EMI instalments , if you’ve converted transactions into EMIs Previous month’s unpaid minimum dues Late payment fees , if applicable 'Credit Card Minimum Due' in some of the Indian Languages Language Translation Explanation in Context Hindi क्रेडिट कार्ड न्यूनतम देय राशि वह न्यूनतम राशि जो समय पर भुगतान करने पर लेट फीस से बचाती है, लेकिन ब्याज जारी रहता है। Marathi क्रेडिट कार्ड किमान देय रक्कम उशीराने शुल्क टाळण्यासाठी किमान भरणा करणे आवश्यक, परंतु उर्वरित रकमेस व्याज लागू होते.

Explaining ‘Minimum Amount Due’ to kids Think of the minimum amount due like the ‘minimum entry fee’ to avoid penalties. If your bill is ₹20,000 and you only pay ₹1,000, the bank won’t fine you, but you’ll still pay interest on the remaining ₹19,000 . This keeps adding up. It’s okay once in a while, but not a healthy habit. Always try to pay the full amount when possible. How Is the Minimum Due Calculated? Here’s a breakdown of a sample calculation: Example: Credit Card Minimum Due Calculation Component Amount (₹) Total Outstanding ₹25,000 EMI Due ₹2,000 Previous Month's Minimum Due ₹500 Charges & Late Fees ₹200 Minimum Amount Due ₹2,700 Most banks including HDFC Bank , SBI Card , ICICI , and Axis Bank use this approach, although exact methods may vary slightly. Should You Only Pay the Minimum Due? Technically, yes, you can just pay the minimum due to avoid penalties. But should you? Interest Implications of Partial Payments When you pay only the minimum: No late fee is charged Interest is still applied on the unpaid balance New purchases may start attracting interest immediately Interest is calculated daily and compounded monthly , leading to higher debt over time Why Paying Only Minimum Hurts Credit Health Consistently making minimum payments can: Increase your overall interest cost Push you into a minimum payment trap Negatively affect your credit score due to high credit utilization What Happens If You Don’t Pay the Minimum? Missing even the minimum due can trigger: Late payment penalties (₹300 to ₹1,200 depending on bank) Interest charges on the entire outstanding balance Reporting to credit bureaus like CIBIL, impacting your credit score ‘No Minimum Due’ - What Does It Mean? Sometimes your card statement might say "No Minimum Due" . This usually means: You have no new transactions You’ve paid the full amount already There is no outstanding balance This is a good sign, but always double-check your statement to be sure. Credit Card Minimum Amount Due vs Total Due Here’s how the minimum due compares to the total amount due : Comparison Table: Minimum Due vs Total Due Criteria Minimum Amount Due Total Amount Due Mandatory to Avoid Fees Yes No Interest on Balance Yes No Credit Score Impact Neutral Positive Financial Burden Lower Higher (short-term) How to Avoid Interest Even After Paying the Minimum Always try to pay the total due , not just the minimum If you can’t pay in full, aim to pay more than the minimum Avoid using your card for new purchases until you clear the balance Consider converting large purchases into EMIs with lower interest rates Use tools like auto-pay or reminders to never miss a payment FAQs on Credit Card Minimum Amount Due Q1. What is the credit card minimum amount due? It is the smallest amount you must pay to avoid late fees. However, you’ll still be charged interest on the remaining balance. Q2. What happens if I only pay the minimum amount due? You avoid penalties but interest keeps accruing on the unpaid amount, increasing your total debt. Q3. Is it okay to pay only the minimum due every month? Only in emergencies. Doing it repeatedly leads to high interest and potential debt traps. Q4. What does it mean when the statement says ‘No Minimum Due’? It means there's nothing to pay for the current cycle — either because you’ve already paid in full or have no new dues. Q5. How is the minimum due calculated? It usually includes 5% of your total due, EMI amounts, any past dues, and charges. In this article Glossary Similar articles that might interest you!

Whether you’re logging into a bank account, completing a UPI transaction, or verifying your Aadhaar for eKYC, OTPs are everywhere. But what exactly is OTP authentication, and why is it considered one of the safest verification methods? Let’s break it down. What Is OTP Authentication? OTP authentication refers to a security process where a One-Time Password (OTP) is generated and sent to the user to verify identity during login, transactions, or sensitive actions. The OTP is typically valid for a short time and can be delivered via SMS, email, authenticator apps , or hardware tokens . It is commonly used as a form of two-factor authentication (2FA) in banking , digital apps, and enterprise systems. In essence, it’s a time-sensitive, single-use password that ensures only you can access or approve a digital action. ‘OTP Authentication’ in some of the Indian languages Language Translation Explanation in Context Hindi ओटीपी प्रमाणीकरण यह एक सुरक्षा प्रक्रिया है जिसमें लॉगिन या लेन-देन की पुष्टि के लिए एक बार उपयोग होने वाला पासवर्ड भेजा जाता है। Marathi ओटीपी प्रमाणीकरण खाते उघडताना किंवा व्यवहार करताना एकदाच वापरण्याचा पासवर्ड वापरून प्रमाणीकरणाची प्रक्रिया.

Malayalam ഒടിപി ഓതന്റിക്കേഷൻ ഒരിക്കല്‍ മാത്രം ഉപയോഗിക്കാവുന്ന പാസ്‌വേഡിലൂടെ happening authentication പ്രക്രിയ. How You Can Explain ‘OTP Authentication’ to Kids Think of OTP authentication like a secret code that works only once. Imagine you’re trying to enter a secure building, and someone gives you a new code each time you enter. Even if someone saw your last code, they can't use it again. That’s what OTP does for your online accounts. How Does OTP Authentication Work? Here’s how the process typically works: Trigger : A login attempt or transaction initiates an OTP request. Delivery : The OTP is sent to the user via a selected method (e.g., SMS or app). Verification : The user enters the OTP within the specified time limit. Access Granted : If correct, the user is authenticated successfully. This method is widely used in India for: Net banking and mobile banking UPI apps like Jupiter, PhonePe, Paytm, Google Pay Aadhaar eKYC verifications Online shopping and bill payments Types of OTPs: SMS, Email, App, Hardware Token Method Medium Validity Time Security Level Example Use Case SMS OTP Mobile Number 30–60 seconds Moderate Banking, UPI login Email OTP Email Inbox 5–10 minutes Moderate Account registration Authenticator App Smartphone App 30 seconds High Secure logins (Gmail, VPN) Hardware Token Physical Device 30 seconds Very High Enterprise VPN access OTP vs Password vs Biometric Authentication Passwords are static and reused, making them easier to compromise. OTP authentication adds dynamic, single-use passwords that change every session. Biometric authentication (like fingerprint or face ID) is based on physical identity. Many systems use OTP as part of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) , combining something you know (password) and something you have (OTP) for higher security. Time-Based vs Counter-Based OTPs There are two main types of OTP algorithms: TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) : Changes every 30 seconds. Used by apps like Google Authenticator. HOTP (HMAC-Based One-Time Password) : Generates OTP based on a counter that increments with every login attempt. TOTPs are more common in consumer apps, while HOTPs are often used in enterprise systems like LDAP or VPN logins. Note: HMAC full form is Hash-based Message Authentication Code LDAP full form is Lightweight Directory Access Protocol OTP Authentication in India: Real-World Use Cases In India, OTPs are a default security mechanism across: Banking : For fund transfers, cardless withdrawals UPI : To authorize payments and register new devices Aadhaar : eKYC for telecom, banking, and income tax e-filing E-commerce : To approve payments and logins Corporate Systems : LDAP authentication, VPN access, employee logins OTP Authentication vs Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) OTP can be: A single-factor authentication (like OTP login without password) A second factor in a 2FA system , enhancing security when used with passwords or biometrics Some of the Best OTP Authenticator Apps & OTP Managers Here are some of the top tools for managing OTPs securely: Google Authenticator Microsoft Authenticator Authy (Twilio) DUO Mobile FreeOTP YubiKey (hardware-based) These apps work offline and provide time-based OTPs , making them more secure than SMS-based OTPs which are vulnerable to SIM swap attacks. FAQs on OTP Authentication Q1. What is OTP authentication? OTP authentication is a security process that uses a one-time password to verify a user’s identity for login or transactions. Q2. How does SMS OTP verification work? An OTP is sent to your mobile number. You enter it within a time window to verify your action or identity. Q3. What is the difference between TOTP and HOTP? TOTP is time-based (changes every 30 seconds). HOTP is counter-based (increases with each login attempt). Q4. Are OTP authenticator apps better than SMS OTP? Yes. They are more secure, work offline, and avoid risks like SMS interception or SIM swap fraud. In this article Glossary Similar articles that might interest you!

Methods, Benefits & Real-World Use By Jupiter Team · July 30, 2025 · 3 min read IN THIS ARTICLE In today’s digital world, passwords alone are no longer enough to keep your online accounts secure. This is where two-factor authentication (2FA) steps in; a simple but powerful security feature that protects your personal data from unauthorized access. What Is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)? Two-factor authentication is a digital security method that requires you to verify your identity using two separate forms of credentials. Usually, the first factor is something you know, like a password. The second is something you have, like a smartphone that receives an OTP or runs an authenticator app. This dual-step process significantly reduces the risk of identity theft and fraud, especially in high-risk environments like banking, social media, and government portals. ‘Two-Factor Authentication' in some of the Indian Languages Language Translation Explanation in Context Hindi दो-चरण प्रमाणीकरण लॉगिन के लिए पासवर्ड के अलावा एक और सुरक्षा तरीका जैसे OTP या ऐप आधारित कोड की आवश्यकता होती है। Marathi दोन स्तर प्रमाणीकरण खाते किंवा प्रणालीमध्ये प्रवेशासाठी दोन स्वतंत्र ओळखी तपासण्याच्या पद्धती.

Think of Two factor authentication (2FA) like locking your front door with a key and a fingerprint scanner. Even if someone copies your key (password) and tries to open the door, they can’t get in without the fingerprint (OTP or app code). This “double lock” keeps your online life much safer. How Does 2FA Work? 2FA adds another layer of protection to your accounts. Here’s how it typically works: Step 1 : Enter your password (something you know) Step 2 : Verify via OTP, app code, or biometric (something you have or are) Unless both steps are completed successfully, access is denied. Even if hackers steal your password, they can’t proceed without the second factor. Why Is Two-Factor Authentication Important? Without 2FA, all a hacker needs is your password. But with two layers of protection, the security of your account increases exponentially. For Indian users, where online banking, UPI apps, and Aadhaar-based services are widespread, 2FA helps prevent phishing attacks, SIM-swap frauds, and identity theft. Common Methods of Two-Factor Authentication Factor Type Examples Something You Know Password, PIN, Secret Answers Something You Have OTP via SMS, Authenticator App, Smart Card Something You Are Fingerprint, Face ID, Iris Scan Two-Factor Authentication vs Multi-Factor Authentication While 2FA uses two layers of identity proof, multi-factor authentication (MFA) can use three or more. For example, logging in with a password (factor 1), then scanning a face (factor 2), and inserting a smart card (factor 3) is MFA. Benefits of Two-Factor Authentication for Indian Users Banking security : Mandatory in most net banking systems UPI apps : OTP-based verification prevents fraudulent transactions Aadhaar authentication : OTP adds an extra safeguard for e-verification Email & social media : Prevents unauthorized logins Examples of 2FA in Daily Life Logging into IRCTC or Income Tax portal with an OTP Verifying a transaction on Paytm, Google Pay, or PhonePe Accessing work systems with DUO or Microsoft Authenticator Best Two-Factor Authentication Systems & Tools (2024) Google Authenticator Microsoft Authenticator Twilio Authy DUO Security YubiKey (hardware-based) Aadhaar OTP (UIDAI services) Two-Factor Authentication for Bank Accounts All major Indian banks such as HDFC, SBI, ICICI, and Kotak use 2FA through OTPs and app-based logins. 2FA on Social Media and Email Platforms like Facebook, Gmail, and Instagram offer built-in 2FA to prevent account takeover. Hardware-Based vs Software-Based 2FA Software-based : OTP, app codes (easy, popular) Hardware-based : Security tokens or smart cards (more secure, enterprise-grade) Common Myths About Two-Factor Authentication Myth : "2FA is inconvenient" Truth : It takes seconds and protects your data. Myth : "Passwords are enough" Truth : Most breaches happen due to stolen or weak passwords. FAQs on Two-Factor Authentication Q1. What is two-factor authentication (2FA)? 2FA is a security process that requires two different forms of identity verification before granting access to an account or device. Q2. How does two-factor authentication work? You enter your password (first factor) and then confirm using an OTP or authenticator app code (second factor). Q3. Is Two Factor Authentication (2FA) better than just using a password? Yes. It adds a second security layer, making it harder for hackers to break in even if your password is leaked. Q4. What are common methods used in 2FA? OTP via SMS, authenticator apps (like Google Authenticator), security keys, and biometric authentication. Q5. Can I use 2FA on social media or banking apps in India? Yes, platforms like Gmail, Facebook, Instagram, and most Indian banking apps support two-factor authentication.

An option to set up a pre-designated account for balance transfer in case of closure or  will be provided at the time of PPI issuance. 4. Fees, Service Charges, and Transaction Processing The Customer acknowledges and agrees that presently, there are no service charges, maintenance fees, or transaction-related charges applicable for the use of the APSPL-issued PPI. APSPL does not impose any fees on loading funds, making payments, or transferring funds from the PPI. However, APSPL reserves the right to introduce or revise service charges ("Service Charges"), fees, or applicable limits in the future, with prior notification provided to the Customer through the Platform. Any such updates will be communicated appropriately, and customers may contact APSPL’s customer support for the latest details. Any funds utilized from the PPI for transactions will be automatically debited from the PPI balance. APSPL’s responsibility is limited to processing the debit from the PPI and facilitating the subsequent payment to any authorized merchant, financial institution, or recipient as directed by the Customer. Validity and Inactivity of PPIs PPI Validity: As per RBI guidelines, PPIs issued by APSPL do not have an  date. Customers may continue to use the PPI as long as it remains active and complies with RBI and APSPL policies. Inactive PPIs: A PPI will be marked as inactive if there is no customer-initiated transaction for a continuous period of 12 months. APSPL will notify the customer through SMS, email, or other means before marking the PPI as inactive. Once inactive, the PPI will be restricted from performing debit transactions until reactivation. Reactivation of Inactive PPIs: To reactivate an inactive PPI, the customer must contact APSPL's customer support and complete any required verification procedures as per APSPL’s policy. Once reactivated, the PPI can resume normal operations. Unutilized Balance on Inactive PPIs: Any unutilized balance in an inactive PPI will remain available for use upon reactivation. In case the customer chooses to close the PPI, the remaining balance will be refunded according to APSPL’s refund policy, subject to applicable charges and verification procedures. Refund Process: If a customer decides to close the PPI or if reactivation is not requested within a reasonable period, the balance will be refunded to the customer’s bank account or the original loading source, as per APSPL’s policies, after completing necessary verification procedures. Customer Obligations and Responsibilities To ensure secure and compliant use of Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs), all Customers are expected to adhere to the following obligations and responsibilities: 5. Safeguarding the PPI and Security Credentials : Customers must take full responsibility for safeguarding their PPI and all associated security credentials, including passwords, PINs, and any other access information. Customers should take measures to protect their PPI against unauthorized use, including: Regularly updating and securing passwords or PINs, avoiding easily guessed combinations. Avoiding sharing security credentials with any third parties, including family members or friends. Enabling device-level security features, such as biometric locks or multi-factor authentication, if supported. APSPL recommends regularly monitoring transaction alerts and statements for early detection of any suspicious activity. 6. Reporting Loss, Theft, or Unauthorized Transactions : In the event of any loss, theft, or unauthorized access to their PPI, customers must report the incident immediately to APSPL through the designated customer support channels. Prompt reporting is crucial, as it enables APSPL to block or restrict the PPI to prevent further unauthorized transactions. Delays in reporting such incidents may increase the customer’s liability for any unauthorized transactions that occur as a result of the breach. APSPL encourages customers to report any suspicious activity as soon as it is detected to limit potential losses. 7. Compliance with Usage Restrictions : Customers are responsible for using the PPI in line with APSPL’s Terms and Conditions, as well as RBI guidelines and applicable legal requirements. Prohibited Uses : The PPI may not be used for any illegal or restricted activities, including gambling, money laundering, or other activities prohibited by RBI regulations. Transaction Limits : Customers must adhere to the applicable transaction limits and restrictions associated with their PPI type (e.g., Min KYC or Full KYC) to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. International Usage : If applicable, customers must ensure that any international transactions comply with the guidelines set forth by APSPL and RBI. Min KYC PPIs, for instance, may be restricted to domestic use only. 7. Account Monitoring and Reporting : Customers should regularly review their PPI transaction history to identify any unauthorized or unusual activity. Customers are expected to promptly report any discrepancies or unrecognized transactions to APSPL to help prevent misuse. Any suspicious or potentially fraudulent activity should be communicated to APSPL as soon as possible to aid in investigation and mitigation. 8. Maintaining Updated Information : It is the customer’s responsibility to keep their contact information up to date, including their registered mobile number and email address, to receive timely alerts and communications regarding PPI activity. Customers must notify APSPL promptly if there are any changes to their personal information that may impact their KYC status or the security of their PPI. 9. Liability for Unauthorized Transactions : Customers may bear responsibility for certain unauthorized transactions if negligence is determined, such as sharing security credentials or failing to report loss/theft in a timely manner. APSPL will assess liability on a case-by-case basis, considering the customer's adherence to these responsibilities, in line with RBI’s guidelines and industry standards. Failure to comply with these obligations may result in APSPL taking appropriate actions, including restricting or suspending the PPI, to protect the customer and APSPL’s platform integrity. Limitation of Liability and Indemnity APSPL’s maximum liability to the customer, under any circumstances, shall not exceed the total balance available on the Customers’ PPI at the time of the incident giving rise to the liability. APSPL shall not be liable for any indirect, consequential, or incidental damages, including, but not limited to, loss of profits, business, or anticipated savings, arising from the use or inability to use the PPI, unauthorized transactions, or any external factors beyond APSPL’s reasonable control, such as network outages, system errors, or third-party security breaches. APSPL does not endorse, promote, or warrant any goods or services that may be purchased or availed using the PPI. APSPL shall not be liable for any claims, damages, losses, or liabilities arising from or in connection with the quality, quantity, or fitness of such goods or services, or any other issues arising from transactions conducted using the PPI. The customer agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold APSPL harmless from and against any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, or expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from or related to: Misuse of the PPI by the customer or any third party acting with the customer's consent or knowledge. Failure to safeguard PPI credentials, leading to unauthorized access or transactions. Any breach of these terms and conditions by the customer or failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Claims arising from third-party actions or any violation of intellectual property or other rights by the customer. This limited liability and indemnity provision are final and binding on the customer from the time of account opening and apply to all APSPL services provided through the PPI. 2. Transaction Monitoring and Reporting APSPL reserves the right to monitor all transactions conducted through the PPI to ensure compliance with applicable laws, prevent fraud, and detect any suspicious or unauthorized activity. In accordance with regulatory requirements, APSPL may: Conduct real-time and periodic transaction monitoring to detect unusual, high-risk, or potentially fraudulent activities. Report any suspicious, illegal, or unauthorized activities to relevant authorities, including the Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND), and cooperate fully with law enforcement agencies as required under applicable law. Suspend or restrict the PPI account temporarily or permanently if any suspicious activity is detected or if the account appears to be used in violation of these terms, or in a manner that may pose a risk to APSPL, its customers, or other third parties. By using the PPI, the customer consents to such monitoring and acknowledges that APSPL may take appropriate actions, including reporting to regulatory and law enforcement authorities, in compliance with applicable regulations and guidelines. 3. Grievance Redressal Mechanism For any issues or complaints related to the Prepaid Payment Instrument (PPI), customers are advised to refer to APSPL’s Customer Grievance Redressal Policy, available on the Jupiter Platform. The policy outlines the process for lodging complaints, escalation mechanisms, contact details, resolution timelines, and customer recourse options in line with applicable regulatory requirements.

Any remaining balance after closure will be refunded following identity verification and subject to regulatory compliance.

Upon account closure, APSPL will refund any unutilized balance in the PPI to the customer. Refunds will be processed within a specified period, typically within 7-10 business days, and credited to the original source of funds or an alternate account as specified by the customer, after completing necessary verifications.

A Loan Against Mutual Funds lets you borrow money by pledging your Mutual Funds. On Jupiter, you can get a
            Loan Against Mutual Funds of up to ₹2 Crore. How much money can I borrow? Your loan limit will depend on the amount and type of Mutual Funds in your portfolio. Can I choose any date for my monthly loan repayment? You can repay the principal amount anytime within 36 months and the interest in 12 EMIs Do I need to pay interest on the whole amount I am eligible for? No, you pay monthly interest only on the withdrawn amount out of the total credit limit given to you. What is lien marking/pledging of Mutual Funds? When you take a Loan Against Mutual Funds, your funds will be lien marked. This means, the lender has the
            right to hold your units and sell them in case the loan isn't repaid. However, your funds will continue
            earning returns and will be redeemable once the loan is fully repaid. Which mutual fund schemes are accepted or can be pledged to take loans? Your loan limit can be up to 75% of the Net Asset Value (NAV) of your Debt Mutual Funds, and 45% of the NAV
            of Equity Mutual Funds. For example, if you have invested ₹3 Lakh in Debt Mutual Funds and ₹1 Lakh in Equity
            Mutual Funds, your available loan limit will be(75% of ₹3 Lakhs) + (45% of ₹1 Lakh) = ₹2.70 Lakh How do I check my limit? You can check your limit on the Jupiter app Can I pledge any Mutual Fund? Yes, you can pledge any eligible Mutual Fund. You can also choose the number of units you want to pledge. When can I redeem the Mutual Funds I have pledged? Your Mutual Funds will be redeemable once your loan is fully repaid What is the tenure of the loan against mutual funds? You can repay the principal amount in up to 36 months and the interest in 12 EMIs What is the credit limit and how is it calculated? Your credit limit is calculated based on the value of your Mutual Funds portfolio Link to doc: LAMF Landing

            rests with you! How is Jupiter not charging the Rs. 250-750 Penalty? Is there any catch or fine-print? When your SIP autopay mandate fails due to insufficient balance, you have to pay a penalty. AMCs don’t
            charge this penalty – banks do. Each bank would have their own penalty charge for not maintaining sufficient
            funds for the Electronic Clearing Service (ECS) mandate to go through. This penalty ranges from 250-750. At
            Jupiter, because you bank and invest on the same app, we smartly pause your SIP for the current month when
            your Jupiter balance is low. No charges, ever Do you mean I don’t get same day’s NAV elsewhere? Most Mutual Fund investment platforms may take a few working days to allocate units after you place an
            order. During this time the NAV can change. On Jupiter, you’re allotted units as per the NAV you see on the
            app (if you invest before 2 PM on working days). Got questions? Our dedicated support team is here 24/7 to help. Contact us Contact us The future of financial wellness starts here.

By Jupiter Team · December 01, 2023 · 8 min read IN THIS ARTICLE With growing awareness about securing one's financial future, the number of people investing in mutual funds has increased drastically over the last few years. However, when planning for your retirement, it is also important to plan on who will use your funds in case of your unexpected demise. By adding a nominee through a simple procedure, you can secure your family’s financial future. Although adding a nominee was optional before, SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) has made it mandatory to add a nominee or opt out of the nomination. The deadline for adding a nominee was 31 March 2022, which was extended by one year until 31 March 2023. However, in a recent circular, SEBI extended the deadline to December 31st, 2023. In case investors fail to add a nominee before the deadline, SEBI will freeze your portfolio, and you won’t be able to invest or withdraw money from your funds. What is a mutual fund nomination? Mutual fund nomination is appointing a person to take charge of your investments after your death. Upon your unexpected demise, your investments will be transferred to your nominee. This process is also called the transmission of units. Why is there a need to add a nominee for a mutual fund? SEBI has made it mandatory to either add a nominee or opt out of a nomination for all investments, including shares and mutual funds. If you fail to do so, your portfolio will freeze, and you won't be able to invest or withdraw money from your funds. So, to make sure your investments do not freeze, you must either add a nominee or opt out of the nomination. However, adding a nominee is far more beneficial than opting out of the nomination. Below are some of the reasons why you must add a nominee. Smooth transfer of funds: If you add a nominee upon your demise, the nominee will get your investments without any hassle. However, if you fail to add a nominee, your beneficiaries will have to go through a long and expensive process to claim the funds. Reduces family feuds: When adding nominees, you can add up to three nominees and allocate a specific percentage of the portfolio to each of them. This reduces the family feud, and you were the one who decided the share for each of the nominees. Removes the hassle of producing any documents: If you do not add a nominee, your family members will be asked to produce a will, a no objection certificate, your death certificate, and other declarations to claim the mutual funds. Imagine a grieving family member going through all the hassle of producing different documents to claim the money. Adding a nominee can reduce the hassle for your family members. Live stress-free: By adding a nominee, you can live a stress-free life knowing your investments will go to the person of your choice. Who can nominate, and who can be a nominee? Although all kinds of investors invest in mutual funds, only a certain category of investors can nominate and be a nominee. The following four questions will give clarity on mutual fund nomination. Who can nominate? Only individuals holding their own units, either individually or jointly, can use the nomination facility. Who cannot make a nomination? A power of attorney (PoA) holder and a guardian investing on behalf of the minor cannot nominate. In the case of a minor, the guardian cannot make a nomination nor be a nominee for the minor's investments. After the minor attains the age of majority, he or she can choose their nominees. Who can be a nominee? All individuals can be nominees, including a minor, NRI, central government, state government, local authority, or religious or charitable trust. In the case of minors, the guardian's name and address must be provided by the person making the nomination. Who cannot be nominated? Any trust (apart from the religious and charitable trust), society, company, partnership firm, and Hindu undivided family (HUF) cannot be nominated for mutual funds. How to nominate people to my mutual fund portfolio and demat account online? Now that adding a nominee to your mutual funds is mandatory, you can add your nominee online. However, you need not visit the website of each and every mutual fund house. Instead, you can add nominees on Karvy (KFintech), CAMS, and MFCentral websites. CAMS and Karvy are mutual fund transfer agents and provide backend services to mutual fund companies. Both CAMS and Karvy handle different asset management companies (AMCs). By logging on to their websites, you can easily update your nomination details for all your mutual funds. Nominee updation with Karvy (KFintech) To update your nominee with Karvy, you must follow the steps below. Click here to go to the Karvy nominee updation page. Enter your PAN number and select all folios. An OTP will be sent to your mobile and registered Email. Enter that OTP to complete verification. After verification, you will see the list of mutual funds you have invested, which Karvy manages. Select the funds and add the nominee details and verify it through OTP. Nominee updation with CAMS To update your nominee with CAMS, follow the steps below. Visit the CAMS nominee updation page and enter your PAN number. Select Email or mobile to receive OTP. Enter it to view all your mutual fund investments under CAMS. Then select all the funds for which you want to update nominee details and click on next. Then select register nominee and enter the nominee details. Click on proceed to add the nominee details and verify it with OTP. You can also update nominee details offline by filling out the nomination form and submitting it to Karvy and CAMS offices. Nominee updation with MF Central MF Central is India's first all in one investment management platform conceived by CAMS and KFintech to transform the mutual fund industry. The platform provides convenience to transact across all your mutual fund folios with unparalleled user experience. The following steps will guide you to update your mutual fund nomination with MF central. Visit the MF central website and create an account using your PAN. Once you login you will see a list of all your mutual funds. Select the funds and update your nominee by providing all necessary details. Confirm it with OTP sent to your mobile or registered email address. Along with mutual funds, SEBI has made it mandatory to add a nominee or opt out of nomination for demat and trading accounts. To add a nominee to your demat account, you must link your mobile number with your Aadhar. First, log in to your account and add nominee details. Then you must e-sign it with the Aadhar OTP. While this is a general procedure, different brokers have different procedures for updating nominee details. Let's look at the procedure to add nominees for some of the most popular brokers. Adding nominee on Groww To add nominees to your demat account with Groww, you must follow the steps below. Login to your account, then go to account details. Go to the add nominee page and fill in the nominee details. Finish it by e-signing with Aadhar OTP. You can add nominees only once online. In case you want to make changes or add more nominees, you must do it offline. Groww’s team can help you with it once you’ve raised a ticket.

Direct vs Regular mutual funds Every mutual fund comes in two plans, the direct plan and the regular plan. Though both plans have the same portfolio, they have different net asset values (NAV) and returns. Following are the major differences between direct and regular mutual funds. Meaning As mentioned above, direct funds do not involve a distributor. You invest directly with the AMC (asset management company) without a financial advisor. You are required to pick mutual funds on your own for your portfolio. In contrast, in a regular plan, you invest through a distributor, who is also an advisor. They will help you choose the best funds based on your goals. Total Expense Ratio (TER) Since you are investing on your own in direct plans, you don't have to pay any commissions, which will reduce the fund's total expense ratio. In the case of regular funds, the expense ratio will be slightly higher as it includes the commissions you must pay the advisor. Net Asset Value (NAV) The net asset value of a fund is the market value of the underlying securities of the scheme. The total expense ratio of a mutual fund is adjusted from the NAV. Since the expense is deducted from the NAV, the NAV for direct plans is slightly higher than regular plans. As a result, the returns will also be higher for direct funds. Control You have full control over your mutual fund portfolio in direct mutual funds. However, with control comes responsibility, and you must put in some effort to study mutual funds and manage your investments. Updating KYC (Know Your Customer), monitoring investments regularly, and other procedural tasks must be done independently. But a little effort can help you make higher returns in the long run. Frequently Asked Questions Which direct mutual fund app is best? Several apps offer direct mutual funds. Check for the additional services they offer apart from offering direct mutual funds, and choose the one you are comfortable with. Some of the best apps to invest in mutual funds are Jupiter Money, Groww, ET Money, MyCams, KFinKart, Coin By Zerodha, Paytm Money Mutual Funds App, Cash Rich and Kuvera. How can I buy direct mutual funds? You can buy direct mutual funds from the AMC directly, or you can buy them through investment platforms that offer direct mutual funds, such as Jupiter or Groww. Is it better to buy mutual funds directly? Investing in direct mutual funds has several benefits over regular mutual funds. Their expense ratio is low, and the returns are also higher. However, you will have to do some homework and put in some effort to manage your investments. Is Groww a direct mutual fund? Groww is a wealth management platform that offers direct mutual funds from 45 AMCs. You can build your mutual fund portfolio or invest in pre-made portfolios that they offer based on your goals. Is it safe to buy direct mutual funds? Highly experienced professionals manage mutual funds, and the platforms that offer direct mutual funds are only a liaison that enables you to invest in mutual funds. Mutual funds are very safe investments, provided you have chosen funds based on your goals and risk appetite. In this article Mutual Fund Investment Similar articles that might interest you!

For Indians, gold has more than just an investment value, and traditionally, most people bought this precious metal in the physical form, such as jewellery , coins, or bullion.ve Investing in gold is still popular because of its high liquidity and inflation-beating returns. Moreover, it is seen that even if the price of this precious metal falls, it is not long-lasting and often makes a strong comeback. Best ways to invest in gold Traditionally, gold was held in the physical form but over the years, other forms have evolved, which include gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), sovereign bond schemes, and gold mutual funds. You may invest in gold online, buy gold jewellery, gold bars and coins also invest in Gold savings schemes and many more.Let us understand each of these options in detail. Digital gold You can buy digital gold via online platforms of various financial technology (fintech) companies. You may invest as little as INR 1 through these platforms, which generally associate with traders and manufacturers. You may transact in the live market at current prices and redeem your investment whenever required. You can either redeem your investment at its present value or opt for physical delivery; however, some platforms may not provide the latter option and you must check this before making your investment decision. Moreover, all your digital gold investments are backed by physical gold. Gold jewellery Buying jewellery  from jewellers is another option to invest in this precious metal. However, this may be an expensive way because of the making charges. When you want to sell your investment, the making charges are not recoverable, which affects your actual returns based on the gold prices prevailing at that time. The making charges can be between 5% and 23% depending on the type of jewellery and the jewellery  you choose. Gold bars and coins Buying gold in bars or coins does not have usage value and is also liable to making charges. However, these are lower when compared to the making charges levied on jewellery. Further, investing in the physical form whether as jewellery, bars, or coins carries the risk of damage or theft. Gold savings schemes These gold schemes are offered by jewellers wherein you invest a particular amount at regular intervals (generally monthly). At the end of the investment period, you can buy jewellery totaling your invested amount. Some jewellers may add a bonus amount to your investment, allowing you to buy jewellery  of a higher sum. While putting money in such gold investment schemes, you need to conduct a thorough background check of the jewellers  to ensure security. Additionally, at the time of buying jewellery , making charges may be applicable, which can erode the bonus given by the jewellers , thus reducing your actual returns. Let us look at the differences between the various ways in which you can invest in gold: Gold Gold ETFs Gold mutual funds You have to buy in physical form You may buy a proportionate value but not hold it in a physical form Investments are in bullion, and in companies that mine the precious metal Dematerialization (Demat) account is not required Investing in ETF gold products requires demat account No demat account is necessary for investing No additional expenses are applicable Brokerage and asset management fees may be levied Minimum fund management charges may be applicable Risk of burglary and theft No risk of theft or burglary No risk of theft or burglary No paperwork requirements Documentation is needed to invest in ETFs Gold funds require some paperwork to be completed while investing Gold prices are in proportion to market fluctuations ETF gold prices are directly affected by the prices of the metal The fund value is not affected by changes in gold prices What are sovereign gold bonds? Sovereign gold bonds are issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on behalf of the Indian Government. The returns on sovereign gold bonds are fixed and presently are 2.5% per annum. These bonds are denominated in grams and the basic unit is one gram. You may invest a maximum of up to four kilograms in these bonds. Sovereign bonds have a maturity period of eight years; however, exits are allowed from the fifth year. These bonds are one of the best ways to invest in gold if you do not want to hold it in its physical form. Documents required for investing in gold If you want to put more than INR 2 lakhs in physical gold, you will need a copy of your Permanent Account Number (PAN) card. To invest in ETFs, you have to open an account with a brokerage firm and a demat account to hold your investment. Know Your Customer (KYC) documents like Aadhar card, PAN card, voter ID, or passport are required if you are buying gold online via sovereign gold bonds. Gold investment vs. mutual funds: Which is a better investment option? One of the basic rules of investing is diversification to mitigate the overall risk of your portfolio. If you are looking for investing in gold or mutual funds, here are some factors you must consider. Factor Gold Mutual funds Management Investments are managed by you Experienced professionals manage the fund corpus Risks Possibility of burglary or theft Safe and secured with minimal risks Returns No dividend income; only capital appreciation Has the potential to deliver significant returns Investible surplus You may need a large amount to make a significant investment based on the prevailing gold prices You can even start your investment with as little as INR 500 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why should you invest in gold? If you are a risk-averse investor, you may look for high liquidity, security, and returns. Gold offers investment security and liquidity and can also deliver relatively good returns. Here are two reasons why you should invest in gold. The precious metal offers inflation-beating returns, and in the long term, gold investment returns are in line with the inflationary increase. The performances of gold and equity markets are inversely related, which means if the stock prices fall, there may be a rise in the value of gold, and this can help balance the overall performance of your investment portfolio. How do I invest in gold via mutual funds? You can invest in gold ETFs or gold funds either offline or online directly with any mutual fund house. Alternatively, you may invest in gold mutual funds via a registered distributor. Moreover, investments in gold funds can be done via systematic investment plans (SIPs). When you choose an SIP, you can put even INR 500 at periodic intervals in your chosen schemes. You can also invest in gold mutual funds through online portals. Why should you consider gold purchase online? Gold is a liquid and safe investment option, especially during market volatility, and it generally delivers inflation-beating returns. Although investing in this precious metal does not generate passive income like dividends or interest, the returns can be relatively stable in the long term. Gold purchases online via ETFs or gold funds offer a convenient way to invest in the precious metal without holding it in its physical form. What is the best way to invest in gold? Traditionally, you could invest in gold either as jewellery , coins, or bars. Today, you may choose between different options like gold ETFs, gold funds, sovereign gold bonds, and digital gold. All of these are excellent ways to invest in this metal; however, they have different purposes. It is recommended you evaluate the various options and choose the ones that best meet your requirements. In this article Mutual Fund Investment Similar articles that might interest you!

Luckily, if you overpay your taxes, you are eligible for an income tax refund. When that money hits your bank account, it is an exhilarating feeling. You can choose to invest it or use it to fund one of your life goals or points on your bucket list! This guide explains everything there is to know about the ITR refund and how to check its status online. Let's start by understanding who is allowed to claim the refund. When Am I Eligible For an Income Tax Refund? Income taxpayers are typically eligible for a refund when the tax paid by them exceeds the tax liability. Tax refunds are typically paid after the end of the financial year. For individual taxpayers, it can take between two weeks to four months. One way to expedite your refund is to file your taxes early. How Is My Income Tax Refund Calculated? The first step to calculating your online refund status is accurately figuring out your tax liability. Take the following factors into consideration: You have paid more tax in advance on the basis of self-assessment than the tax payable on the basis of regular assessment. The TDS paid on your salary, securities, dividends and other sources of income is higher than the tax payable on the basis of regular assessment. Your income is already taxed in a foreign country with which the Government of India has an agreement to avoid double-taxation. Your investments come with tax benefits and deductions, which you have not declared. If your gross tax liability on the total taxable income is less than your net tax liability, the extra amount will be refunded to your account. How Will My Income Tax Refund Be Processed? The first step is to file your returns online every year before the deadline. The earlier you file, the better because your income tax refund can be expedited. Once you have filed your returns, your income tax returns must be verified electronically via an Aadhaar number OTP or EVC generated through your registered bank account. Your tax returns can also be physically verified. In this case, you must submit a signed ITR-V (acknowledgement) to the Centralised Processing Centre (CPC) within 120 days of filing the return. The CPC located in Bengaluru processes your income tax returns. If the taxes paid are higher than the liability, an income tax refund order is generated. Finally, the refund order is transferred to the ITR banker, which then credits the refund to your registered bank account. How Will I Receive My Tax Refund? An income tax refund can be paid in two ways. One way is paying it via an account payee cheque drawn in favour of the taxpayer. Alternatively, it can be directly credited to your bank account that was added while filing your returns. Make sure that you add your bank details correctly. How Can I Check My Income Tax Refund Status? Check Online ITR Refund Status Via E-Filing Portal If you have registered on the e-filing website, you can follow these steps to check your income tax refund status. Visit the e-filing portal . Click on the 'Login' button in the top right corner of the website. Enter your user ID. If your Aadhaar is linked to your PAN card, you can input the Aadhaar number. If not, enter your PAN. Click on 'e-File' on the top menu bar and select 'Income Tax Return'. Then click on 'View Filed Return'. You will then see the statuses of all the returns you have filed. Check Online ITR Refund Status Via NSDL Portal One of the quickest ways to check your ITR refund status is through the NSDL Portal. Click here , and you will immediately arrive on the refund status page. Enter your PAN Number, assessment year and the captcha code on the page. Press 'Proceed'. 4. You will be taken to a page that displays your NSDL refund status. What Are the Types of Income Tax Refund Status? Not Determined: Your online ITR refund is still being processed. Revisit this page in a few days to see if the status changes. Refund Paid: This means either a cheque has been dispatched or the refund has been credited to your bank account. Refund Failed: The IT Department could not process your refund because your bank account details are incorrect or incomplete. You must request a refund re-issue and ensure the details are filled out properly. Refund Expired: Failure to encash your cheque within 90 days will result in your refund expiring. If you see this message, you must request the IT department to issue another cheque. The Cheque Has Been Encashed: This means your cheque has been cashed. Check to see if the amount reflects in your bank account. Refund Returned: If you fail to receive the cheque, it is sent back to the IT Department. If you see this status, you need to request a refund re-issue via the income tax portal. Refund Adjusted Against Last Year’s Outstanding Demand: You will see this status if your refund is adjusted against any previous outstanding tax demand. The IT department sends an intimation for such an adjustment, which you must respond to within 30 days. If you don't respond, the department will proceed as per their suggestions. Can I Earn Interest on Refund of Income Tax? Yes, absolutely. If you paid excess tax in advance, your refund will be granted with interest. Under section 244A, you are eligible for interest as follows: If the refund is 10% or more of your taxes, you qualify for an interest rate of 0.5% per month or part of a month. The interest is calculated from April 1st of the assessment year, i.e., the year after the financial year, until the date your refund is granted. FAQs Q. What are the various forms in which taxes are paid? The forms of taxes include TDS, self-assessment tax payments, advance tax payments, and foreign tax credits. Q. How is my refund calculated? You must file your tax returns by declaring income earned during the financial year, investments made, deductions claimed, and taxes already paid. When the tax paid is more than the tax payable, you will get a refund. Q. Is it important for me to know the refund amount? Yes, it is extremely important to know the refund amount. Sometimes, there could be a calculation error by the department. If that is the case, knowing the amount will help you request a refund re-issue. Q. Why must I verify my returns? Without verification, the Centralised Processing Centre (CPC) will not process your ITR, and consequently, your refund. Q. How long does it take to get an income tax refund? If you are a salaried person, your refund may be credited within two weeks, especially if you have filed your returns early on. On average, the estimated time span for the ITR is between one and four months. For businesses, the return can take between 3 to 6 months to be processed. Q. If my income tax refund is not processed, what do I do? If your ITR is not processed, you must create a refund request for failed requests. You can log into the income tax filing website, click on "Services" and then "Refund Re-issue". If it indicates that there is no failed request, you can visit the grievances section and file a request there. In this article Mutual Fund Investment Similar articles that might interest you!

They suit investors with low-risk appetite or investors nearing retirement. These funds invest in both equity and debt securities and hence are hybrid in nature. However, their portfolio is more skewed towards low-risk debt instruments. Read to find out more about the best conservative mutual funds. What are Conservative Hybrid Mutual Funds? According to SEBI, conservative hybrid mutual funds are open-ended funds that should invest 10-25% of their assets in equities and 75-90% of the assets in debt. On the one hand, they are relatively low-risk investments than pure equity funds. On the other hand, they give better returns than pure debt funds due to their limited exposure to equity. This could be why they are perfect for low-risk investors looking for predictable returns. They are ideal for an investment horizon of three years. The following are the features of conservative mutual funds: Returns: These funds give better returns than fixed deposits and pure debt funds due to their exposure to equity. Moreover, they give predictable returns making them a good alternative to government securities. Risk: Since these funds invest a majority of the assets in debt securities, they are considered low-risk investments. Asset allocation: These funds invest 75-90% of the assets in low-risk investments like government securities, treasury bills, bonds, and debentures. The rest 10-25% is invested in large-cap stocks, which are well-established entities giving stable returns than mid-cap and small-cap companies. 10 Best Conservative Funds (Based on 3 Year Returns) Scheme Name AuM (Cr) 6 Month YTD 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 5 Year 10 Year Sundaram Debt Oriented Hybrid Fund - Direct Plan - GrowthConservative Hybrid Fund 30.03 0.0057 -0.0049 4.15% 8.04% 9.70% 6.07% 8.35% Axis Regular Saver Fund - Direct Plan - GrowthConservative Hybrid Fund 407.7 -0.0069 -0.0073 2.12% 5.66% 9.66% 6.90% 8.90% DSP Regular Savings Fund - Direct Plan - GrowthConservative Hybrid Fund 199.29 0.0109 -0.0019 3.19% 5.82% 9.06% 5.85% 8.11% HSBC Conservative Hybrid Fund - Direct Plan - GrowthConservative Hybrid Fund 122.02 0.002 -0.0018 2.59% 5.51% 8.88% 7.40% 8.44% Nippon India Hybrid Bond Fund - Direct Plan - GrowthConservative Hybrid Fund 716.19 0.0222 0.0056 5.37% 7.35% 8.87% 3.35% 7.04% Franklin India Debt Hybrid Fund - Direct - GrowthConservative Hybrid Fund 246.57 0.0088 -0.0041 5.28% 5.44% 8.39% 6.80% 8.79% Baroda BNP Paribas Conservative Hybrid Fund - Direct Plan - GrowthConservative Hybrid Fund 501.67 0.007 -0.0003 4.07% 5.29% 8.27% 7.60% 9.23% Navi Regular Savings Fund - Direct Plan - GrowthConservative Hybrid Fund 26.99 0.007 -0.0074 4.41% 4.57% 7.19% 6.43% 8.13% LIC MF Debt Hybrid Fund - Direct Plan - GrowthConservative Hybrid Fund 61.5 0.0013 -0.0045 2.36% 4.55% 7.07% 6.59% 7.48% Bandhan Regular Savings Fund - Direct Plan - GrowthConservative Hybrid Fund 140.61 -0.0067 -0.0064 1.25% 3.20% 6.34% 5.94% 8.04% Updated - As of March 14, 2023. How to Select the Best Conservative Hybrid Mutual Funds to invest? When investing in conservative hybrid funds, you must consider the following factors. Investment goal and horizon: Before investing, it is important to understand your goals. First, see whether your goal is short-term or long-term. If your goal can be achieved in less than three years, it is a short-term goal; else, it is a long-term goal. Then determine in how many years you want to achieve it. This will help determine your investment horizon. For conservative funds, your ideal investment horizon is around three years. So for short-term goals, this could be your go-to fund. Fund performance: When selecting a fund for investment, check its performance. You cannot check the performance in isolation. It must be compared to the benchmark and its peers to see how well it is performing. Select funds that perform better than the benchmark and other funds in the category. Risk-adjusted returns: Besides checking the returns, it is important to check standard deviation, alpha, beta, Sharpe and Sortino ratio. The higher the alpha, Sharpe and Sortino ratio, the better the fund. Standard deviation is a measurement of risk and has to be on the lower side. Compare these ratios with the category average and the benchmark to see where the fund is standing with respect to others. Costs: Every fund has an expense ratio, which is the cost of managing the fund. The lower the expense ratio, the better, as the costs are deducted from the profits. Apart from this, the exit load is charged if you exit the fund before a specified time. Compare the costs with other funds and select the one with the least expenses. Fund manager: Fund managers play a crucial role with respect to the fund's performance. They decide the asset allocation of the fund, which impacts the returns. Hence it is best to choose a fund with experienced fund managers having a good track record. Advantages of Conservative Hybrid Funds Diversification: Conservative hybrid funds invest in equity and debt securities, automatically providing diversification to the portfolio. While the investment in debt is high, giving principal protection, the little exposure to equity ensures better returns than debt funds. Low volatility: These funds predominantly invest in debt securities, hence aren’t exposed much to market volatility. When compared to equity funds, the risk in these funds is significantly low. Hence, they suit investors with low-risk tolerance. Better than FD returns: Since they invest in debt and equity instruments, they give returns that are higher than fixed deposits. The debt portion safeguards the principal, and equity ensures capital appreciation. Limitations of Conservative Hybrid Funds Not risk-free: Although conservative funds invest a majority of the assets in debt funds, they are not entirely risk-free. They are subject to default risk and interest rate risk. Default risk or credit risk is the risk of not receiving the principal amount. Interest rate risk is the fluctuation in interest rate causing volatility in the returns. Apart from this, the equity portion is exposed to market risks. Fund manager’s expertise: The fund's performance depends on the asset allocation which the fund manager decides. Hence, the fund's success depends on the fund manager. The fund manager must have enough expertise to manage both equity and debt investments. Low returns: These funds give lower returns than pure equity or aggressive funds in a bullish market, as their exposure to equity is low. How are the best Conservative Hybrid Mutual Funds taxed? Conservative funds are hybrid in nature, but they predominantly invest in debt securities. Hence for the purpose of taxation, they are treated as pure debt funds. The short-term capital gains are the gains earned if you redeem your investment before a period of three years from the date of investment. They are taxed at the investor's income tax slab rate. The long-term capital gains are earned after a period of three years from the date of investment and are taxed at 20% with an indexation benefit. Indexation benefit factors inflation when applying taxes to your capital gains. In other words, since inflation reduces the actual returns, the effect of inflation on the returns is considered before applying taxes. Due to the indexation benefit, the overall taxes to be paid comes down. Who Should Invest in Conservative Hybrid Funds? As the name suggests, conservative hybrid funds are for low-risk investors looking for inflation-beating returns with capital preservation. These are ideal for such investors as they invest majorly in debt securities. These funds also suit investors with an investment horizon of three years. The investment in equity is very low; hence, three years is enough time for the debt securities to mature, along with slight capital appreciation from equities. For investors nearing their long-term goals, conservative funds can be an excellent option as they have low risk and require a minimum investment horizon. Investors can switch from equity to conservative funds to preserve their gains and slowly withdraw them through a systematic withdrawal plan (SWP) to fulfil their financial goals. How to invest in Conservative Hybrid Mutual Funds? You can invest in conservative hybrid funds through online and offline modes. Offline: You can directly approach an investment advisor who will take care of your investments. Alternatively, you can invest on your own by visiting the office of the mutual fund you select. Remember to do your due diligence before selecting a fund for investment. Online: You can invest online through the asset management company's website or app or invest through a mutual fund platform. Several platforms offer regular and direct plans, and you have to choose the one you are comfortable with and start investing. Jupiter Money is an online platform where you can invest in mutual funds within minutes from the comfort of your home. Frequently Asked Questions How long should I stay invested in conservative hybrid mutual funds? There is no fixed tenure for conservative hybrid funds, but it's best to stay invested for a minimum of three years to reap maximum benefits. If you want to invest for a longer period, select an equity fund to draw the maximum potential of your money. Where do the best conservative hybrid mutual funds invest? The best conservative mutual funds invest in debt securities like bonds and debentures and government securities like treasury bills. They also invest in large-cap companies, which are well-established entities having slightly lower risk than mid-cap and small-cap companies. What kind of returns can I earn from conservative hybrid funds? On average, you can earn 8-10% returns from conservative hybrid mutual funds. If you want to earn a higher return, then you must take a higher risk and invest in pure equity funds. Are conservative mutual funds low-risk? Yes, conservative mutual funds are low-risk investments as they invest in debt securities. Debt securities give fixed, and predictable returns and hence conservative funds are considered low-risk investments. Are conservative hybrid funds safe? Conservative funds have low risk but are not entirely safe. They are exposed to default risk, interest rate risk, and market risk. Default risk is the risk of not receiving money from the debtor. Interest rate risk is the effect of interest rate fluctuations on a fund's return. Lastly, market risk is the risk of market volatility on the fund. Since conservative funds invest in equity and debt, they are exposed to these three kinds of risks. However, they are slightly less risky than aggressive and pure equity funds.

Mutual funds offer good returns but have a risk element. Due to market volatility and dependent conditions, you can expect a roller-coaster investment journey. That means a fund or index’s past performance cannot be considered a future indicator of its performance. However, this does not mean you need to shy away from investing. You can get good returns on your mutual funds by managing the associated risks. For instance, you should be aware of how to invest for maximum gains at minimum risk. Active and passive investing are two investing types that you can apply to get the best from your investments. Both types compare gains across common benchmark indices. Actively managed funds follow a direct investing approach. A passively managed fund tries to follow the performance of a specific benchmark index. Continue reading this article to understand the differences between actively and passively managed funds and to evaluate the best strategy for you to achieve your investment goals. What are Actively Managed Funds? Actively managed funds are funds that are directly managed by dedicated fund managers with expertise in market analysis and research. The active investing strategy aims at gaining revenue by outperforming certain index returns or benchmark indices through frequent trading. Equity funds, debt, and hybrid mutual funds are popular examples of active funds. You can undertake active investing yourself or through professionals via actively managed funds and active exchange-traded funds (ETFs). What are Passively Managed Funds? Passive funds are not actively managed by a fund manager. They are managed to follow the performance of a standard index to maximize returns. For example, the passive fund- Nifty BeES tracks the benchmark Nifty 50 Index to duplicate the benchmark's performance and translate it into returns. ETFs and index funds are common passively managed funds. ETFs are funds that aim to duplicate the pattern of a particular stock index. What is Benchmark? Benchmark refers to an index/standard for measuring the overall performance of a mutual fund. The benchmark provides information on how much your investment should have earned compared to actual returns earned. BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty are the two benchmark indices in the Indian stock markets. Normally, a mutual fund house decides a certain fund's benchmark index. In an ideal market scenario, mutual funds should try to match their benchmark returns. How Do Actively Managed Funds Work? For actively managed funds, the fund managers take all relevant decisions regarding the underlying securities to generate revenue by beating a particular benchmark index. Such decisions include tracking the market performance, individual stock performance, analyzing your portfolio investments, and so on. So, there is a lot of detailed market research and analysis required before selecting the desired stock holdings. A fund manager frequently trades in active funds to generate the maximum return on your portfolio investment. How Does a Passively Managed Fund Work? A passively managed fund works on purchasing and holding securities through various market conditions to achieve the desired returns over the long term. There is no active decision-making involved. A passive fund manager attempts to follow the performance of passive funds like ETFs and Index Funds against benchmark indices. Minimal trading is conducted to generate maximum long-term returns. If the benchmark index changes, the passive fund manager makes adjustments accordingly. They realign your passive funds to follow the performance of the benchmark index. Such fund realignment could include purchasing or selling stocks to match the revised benchmark index performance. Differences Between Actively Managed Funds and Passively Managed Funds Parameters Active Funds Passive Funds Management Style 1. The fund manager has the right to select and time trades, including buying, holding, selling, and weighing the investments 2. Fund managers undertake active and detailed research and look for various investments opportunities before investing 1. Passive fund managers are not actively involved. 2. Passive fund managers buy and hold securities relevant to a benchmark index like the Nifty 50 Index Performance Objective 1. Beating the benchmark index is the main performance goal 2. Actively managed funds attempt to beat a broad market index like BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty to maximize returns 1. Following the performance of the benchmark index is the main performance goal 2. Passively managed funds only attempt to match the benchmark index performance (fewer fees) and not beat it 3. A passively managed fund would try to imitate the performance of its benchmark index less the management fees Returns Could generate higher returns over the short-term passive Passive investing gives higher average returns with lowers costs over the long term Costs 1. Active funds have higher expense ratios than passive funds 2. Actively managed funds require more in-depth research, analysis, and trading than passive funds 1. Passive funds are cheaper compared to active funds as they have few transactions 2. Passive investing does not require in-depth market analysis daily as it tries to replicate a benchmark index to optimise returns over time. So, fewer transactions lead to lower costs. Risk 1. Riskier than passive funds 2. Actively managed funds focus on individual securities 3. Active funds like equity funds try to beat the benchmark index in a volatile market, so the chances of returns and risk are high. 1. Less risky compared to active investing 2. Passive investing strategies focus on the overall fund performance 3. You can easily diversify your portfolio across a wide range of stocks and bonds like index funds and ETFs 4. A diversified portfolio reduces the risk of loss Transparency 1. Active funds are less transparent than passive funds 2. Fund managers do not disclose their investment approach owing to competition 3. Investors cannot know how their money is invested 1. Passive investing is more transparent than active investing 2. An index gets tracked against its benchmark index. 3. Investors can track the fund's performance Tax Efficiency 1. They are less tax efficient than passively managed funds 2. Actively managed funds involve higher buying and selling transactions in the fund. 3. Thus, they generate higher capital gain distributions meaning more capital gain tax to be paid by investors 1. More tax efficient than actively managed funds 2. Passive investing involves fewer trading transactions within the index fund 3. So, fewer capital gains are generated, leading to less tax on capital gains for investors Which are Better—Actively Funds or Passive Funds? There is no one best investment strategy. It all depends on the investor’s goals, funds available, tenure, and risk appetite. If you have a high-risk appetite and want higher returns over the short term, you could consider actively managed funds.  However, as all mutual funds are subject to market risk, there are no guaranteed returns. If you prefer low-risk investments with a  long-term investment horizon, then a passively managed fund would be the right strategy for you. You could also consider both investment strategies. Signing Off Both actively and passively managed funds aim to maximise investor returns. However, they differ in certain respects. For instance, a passively managed fund offers safety and diversification, while actively managed funds may generate higher returns over the short term. Based on your investment goals, risk-taking, commitment, and investment horizon, you could select between the two strategies. Note: The content in this article is not a piece of financial advice. Please consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions. FAQs 1. Are mutual funds actively or passively managed funds? Mutual funds can be both passively and actively managed. 2. What makes actively managed funds attractive to investors? Investors invest in actively managed funds for their potential to beat their benchmark. Also, actively managed funds have key strategies to complement your portfolio’s index funds, thus maximising your returns. 3. Are actively managed funds worth the risk? Actively managed funds are ideal for investors who want high returns from their investments, as active fund managers try to invest in funds that can beat their benchmarks. 4. Is passive investing cheaper than active investing? In a passively managed fund, the fund managers do not decide which securities to invest in. In active investing, a fund manager has to undertake in-depth research and analyse opportunities before investing in funds involving costs. So, passive investing is cheaper than active investing.

By Jupiter Team · February 11, 2023 · 6 min read IN THIS ARTICLE Investors have different goals when it comes to investing. While some are eyeing wealth creation, others want a passive income. If you are later, then you should select such instruments that provide regular returns on your investments. Dividend yield funds are one of them. Dividend yield fund managers typically invest in businesses that generate steady cash flows and are able to pay dividends consistently. Moreover, such businesses typically don't cut their payout during a slump. Let’s have an in-depth understanding of mutual fund dividend yield funds . What are Dividend Yield Funds? In simple terms, dividend yield funds are those funds that provide returns in the form of a mutual fund dividend to the shareholders. Dividend yield funds are passive income-generating funds ideal for those investors who want a regular inflow of income from their investments. A dividend yield fund places its capital in equities with dividend yields that are higher than the market average. It is pertinent to note that the equities in which dividend yield funds invest (70% to 80%) are higher than the Sensex or the Nifty 50. The remaining 30-20% of stocks are invested in any profitable avenues without reservations. Compared to their growth-oriented peers, mutual fund dividend yield funds are typically less volatile thanks to the nature of their investments. This is because these companies are usually liquidity rich and have adequate reserves and therefore are more stable than their peers. However, experts often warn dividend yield funds to underperform in comparison to their growth fund peers in the rising market. Nevertheless, these funds suit conservative investors looking to invest in equity funds. How Do Dividend Yield Funds Work? Some companies declare huge dividends, while others do not declare dividends at all. Some companies distribute dividends when they make good profits and want to distribute the same to the shareholders. While other companies prefer to retain their profits for company operations and expansion. In such cases (when companies prefer to retain their profits), the share value of the company increases, leading to compounding in the future, which is ideally suited for wealth creation. Dividend yield funds, therefore, invest 70%-80% of the corpus in equity and equity instruments of companies that pay huge dividends. Such companies have good cash flows and are often considered more stable than other companies. Further, what matters here is not high mutual fund dividends but a high dividend yield. Let’s understand with a practical example: Suppose you invest in two dividend-yielding stocks, i.e., stock A and stock B. While stock A provides a dividend of Rs. 100 per share, stock B provides a dividend of Rs. 300 per share. Stock B seems attractive, right? Why not because it gives more dividends than stock A. However, the tables turn when we come to know their share price. While the price of stock A is Rs. 500, the price of stock B is Rs. 2500. Let’s calculate their dividend yield with a simple formula: Dividend yield = Dividend per share / current price per share * 100 Stock A = Rs. 100 / 500 * 100 = 20% Stock B = Rs. 300 / 2500 * 100 = 12% The dividend yield of stock A is 20%, while the dividend yield of stock B is 12%. Therefore, even though stock B is paying a higher dividend, it is still less when compared to stock A because you can just purchase five stocks of A at Rs. 2500 and earn Rs. 500 as a dividend instead of purchasing one stock of B at Rs. 2500 and earning Rs. 300 as a dividend. Who Should Invest in Dividend Yield Funds? Well, here comes the interesting part: who should invest in mutual fund dividend yield funds ? If you belong to those categories of investors who want to generate a passive income, then you should go for dividend yield funds. Dividend yield funds provide investors with a regular passive income that helps them meet their costs and expenses. Benefits of Investing in Dividend Yield Funds Here comes the ‘why’ part, i.e., why you should invest in dividend yield funds. While it can have many reasons, you should certainly consider the following benefits of investing in dividend yield funds: · Investors of dividend yield funds receive a regular income from their investments due to high mutual fund dividend payouts from the underlying equity instruments · Companies paying huge dividends are often stable, and stocks of such companies can sail through volatility and fluctuations easily · These funds are ideal for beginners for whom return on investment is important to stay motivated and kick-start their investment journey · The investors of dividend-yielding funds not only get returns in the form of dividends but also receive returns in the form of capital appreciation Fees and Charges of Dividend Yield Funds Dividend yield funds, like any other mutual fund, also involve certain fees and charges. Dividend yield funds are actively managed funds, unlike index funds, which are passively managed. Therefore, dividend yield funds involve a higher charge as compared to their passively managed counterparts. The following are the charges you should keep in mind while investing in dividend yield funds: Brokerage charges: These are the charges levied by the stockbroker. It depends upon the terms and conditions of the broker you select Expense ratio: The expense ratio is the charge of maintenance and administration of funds. These charges usually vary among different funds, and the expense ratio for passively managed funds (like index funds) is lower than the actively managed funds (dividend yield funds). This is because the actively managed funds also involve higher fund manager fees for actively managing the portfolio. Always check the expense ratio before investing in any fund because it directly reduces your return on investment Commissions: If you invest in dividend yield funds through a mutual fund agent or mutual fund distributor, then you ought to know about the commission charges. Mutual fund houses pay the mutual fund agents and distributors certain commissions for selling the mutual fund schemes. These commissions are paid from the returns earned by the mutual fund schemes and, therefore, directly get reduced from your returns. However, if you invest in direct funds, then you can save on commission costs. In the long run, these can significantly increase your returns. For investing in direct funds, you can visit Jupiter Money , which allows you to invest in some of the best direct mutual funds. Account opening charges: If you open a Demat account with any stock broker to invest in the dividend yield funds, then you might have to pay account opening charges depending upon the stockbroker. Account maintenance charges (AMC): Account maintenance charges are the annual charges that you have to pay to the stock brokers to maintain your account with them. Other charges: Other charges can include depository participant charges, STT (basically a tax), entry and exit load, etc. Working of Dividend Yield Funds Dividend yield funds pool money from investors and invest the majority of the money in high dividend-paying companies. The remaining portion may be invested in other companies that the fund manager believes has the potential to generate high returns. When these companies release dividends, these dividends are passed on to the investors. Thus, dividend yield funds act as a great source of passive income. In a Nutshell If you are looking for an ideal source of passive income, then you can invest in dividend-yielding funds. What makes funds preferable to dividend-yielding stocks is the fact that funds provide the benefit of diversification of the portfolio, which directly reduces the risk of investment. Start your investments now to start your passive income. Note: this article is not a piece of investment advice. Professional consultation prior to making any significant investment decisions is highly advised. Frequently Asked Questions What is the difference between actively managed funds and passively managed funds? Actively managed funds are those where the funds are managed by a fund manager, whereas passively managed funds just track a specified index or underlying asset. Is there an exit load on dividend-yielding funds? An exit load is usually charged when you sell your mutual fund units. The percentage of exit load depends upon the terms of the scheme. What are the other avenues where mutual fund dividend yield funds invest apart from dividend-yielding equity shares? Dividend-yielding shares invest 75%-80% of the corpus in dividend-yielding equity and equity-related instruments, whereas the remaining corpus is invested in different high-return generating avenues as decided by the fund manager.

More people are actively showing interest in investments. As per a survey reported by the Times of India , 2 in 5 families are likely to invest in equities or mutual funds. Out of the population surveyed, 10% showed interest in equity investing, while 31% showed interest in mutual fund investment. Interestingly, mutual funds also tend to invest in equity instruments. Let’s decode everything you need to know about equity investments. Equity vs. Non-Equity Investments When it comes to investment, investment instruments can be broadly classified into equity and non-equity investments. Equity Investments This encompasses investments in equity instruments. Equity instruments are basically the equity shares issued by companies to raise capital from the public. Equity investments comprise investments in either the listed shares or unlisted shares, the former being predominant. Listed shares trade on recognised stock exchanges like National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange. Non-Equity Investments This comprises investment in instruments other than equity instruments. This can include all other investment avenues like bonds, fixed deposits, gold, real estate, or even crypto investments. Types of Equity Investments You would be happy to know that there are multiple types available to investors for investing in equity instruments. This includes: Equity Shares: This is when you directly invest in equity shares of the company (discussed in detail later). Equity funds: This involves investing in those funds that invest in equity shares of the company (discussed in detail later). Futures: Futures are one type of derivative instrument. It derives its value from the underlying asset, which can be equity shares, currency or commodities as well. Investors can trade in equity futures as part of their equity investment strategy. Options: Options are also a type of derivative instrument. Options give the option holder the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset. Here also, the underlying asset can be equity shares, currency, or commodities. What Are Equity Shares? As stated earlier, equity shares are the instruments used by companies to raise capital. While for the company, it is a method of financing, for investors, it is an instrument to invest and earn returns. Equity shares represent a unit or part ownership in the company. The entire share capital of the company can be divided into units of small denominations. These units are known as equity shares. What are Equity Funds? Funds are nothing but pooling money from various investors and investing it in the underlying asset as per the terms of the fund. These are commonly known as mutual funds. Equity funds are that category of mutual funds that invest in equity shares issued by companies. Equity funds can be classified into different categories based on the type of equity shares in which the funds are invested. This can include dividend funds, growth funds, small-cap funds, mid-cap funds, large-cap funds, etc. Risks Associated With Equity Investments Equity investments are one of the most profitable and return-generating investment avenues. When you invest in equity, you are investing in the company that has issued those equity shares. Therefore, equity investments also come with certain associated risks. This include: Market Risk: This is the biggest risk of investing in equity instruments. As equity shares are traded in the market, they are volatile. Multiple factors affect the prices of equity shares like demand (buyers), supply (sellers), political scenarios, macroeconomic factors, government policies, etc. Financial Risk: As stated earlier, investing in equity shares means investing in the company. This creates a financial risk for equity investors. If there is a disruption in the profitability or business of the company, then ultimately, its share price will drop, and the shareholders will suffer a loss. Liquidity Risk: This shows how easily you can convert your equity investments into cash by selling them at or near their market value. Listed securities are highly liquid as you can sell your shares anytime during trading hours and withdraw your money. However, if you are investing in unlisted equity shares, then you need to consider whether the investment is liquid or not. This is because you may have to find buyers for your shares, unlike listed shares being sold in the stock market. Settlement Risk: This can happen when the seller does not deliver equity securities after receiving money, or the cash is not received after delivering the security. Conducting transactions through the stock exchange can help avoid such risks. Currency Risk: Investors face currency risk when they invest in equity shares of foreign companies. While your native currency is INR, you can invest in US companies in $. Thus any currency fluctuation will ultimately increase or reduce your gains or losses. How to Lower Risk in Equity Investments? To lower risk on equity investments, investors can follow the below-mentioned tips: Do thorough research about the company and the industry before investing. Activate stop loss to minimize your loss. Derivatives like futures and options involve more risk than equities. Therefore, you should trade in them only after obtaining thorough knowledge. If you are not investing for a longer term, then timing the market is important. You need to enter and exit the market at the right time to book profits. Equity Shares Vs. Equity Funds While equity shares involve direct investment in the shares of the company, equity funds involve investing in multiple equity shares at the same time. This reduces the overall risk as your investment is diversified between multiple equity shares. Further, equity funds are professionally managed by expert fund managers. Thus, new investors can benefit from their expertise. Seasoned investors often go for direct equity investment as they have thorough investment knowledge. Who Should Make Equity Investments? Those investors who are looking to earn good returns and have moderate to high-risk appetites can go for equity investments. If you are new to investing world, then you can go for equity funds as they are less risky as compared to direct equity investments. Further, you don’t need to worry much about the selection of stocks as this is handled by expert fund managers. In a Nutshell Equity investments are gaining popularity among investors. In today’s time, when inflation is skyrocketing, it is important to invest in avenues that provide above-inflation returns. Traditional investment avenues are unable to meet such high return benchmarks, and therefore, equities are looked upon by investors to grow their wealth.

By Jupiter Team · September 06, 2021 · 5 min read IN THIS ARTICLE Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) is an open-ended diversified equity mutual fund plan that provides the opportunity to earn higher returns on your investment along with tax benefits. Read on to know more about this scheme. What is ELSS? ELSS includes diversified equity funds that invest most of the corpus in the shares of listed companies as per the fund investment philosophy. The investee companies are chosen across different market capitalization and industries. The primary objective of ELSS funds is to maximize the returns over the long term. The fund manager chooses the listed companies after in-depth research to deliver optimal risk-adjusted returns to the investors. What are the features of ELSS funds? Some of the features of ELSS mutual funds are as follows: At least 80% of the fund corpus is invested in equities and equity-related instruments. Any income earned is considered as long-term capital gains (LTCG) and taxed as per the existing rules. Fund corpus is diversified across different industries, market capitalization, and sectors. Your investment is eligible for tax benefits under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The minimum lock-in period is three years with no maximum limit for the investment horizon. Who should invest in ELSS? Salaried individuals A portion of your salary may be invested in Employee Provident Fund (EPF), which is a fixed-income instrument. Therefore, to enjoy tax benefits while balancing the risk and return on your overall investment portfolio, opting for an ELSS scheme is advisable. First-time investors If you are starting your investment journey, ELSS is a good option to understand the workings of mutual funds and equity. Although these financial products entail certain risks, if you stay invested for five years or longer, this risk can be mitigated. What are the benefits of ELSS? Tax benefits offered by ELSS funds The ELSS tax-saving benefit is available on the principal investment for an amount of up to INR 1.50 lakhs per year under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, the investment has a three-year lock-in period. You may redeem it after three years and the gains are taxed as LTCG, which are tax-free for up to INR 1 lakh per annum. Any additional returns exceeding INR 1 lakh are taxed at 10% without any indexation benefits. Other benefits In addition to the ELSS tax benefits, some other advantages are as follows: Shorter lock-in period Compared to options like National Pension System (NPS) and Public Provident Fund (PPF), ELSS has a shorter lock-in period, which is of three years. NPS investment is locked in until retirement and PPF has a 15-years lock-in period. Regular income If you choose the dividend option while investing in ELSS, you can earn a regular income during the lock-in period. This additional income can help in meeting your day-to-day expenses and reduce your financial burden. Possibility of earning higher returns Compared to other tax-saving instruments like PPF and fixed deposits (FDs), ELSS offers the opportunity to earn higher returns on your investments. Unlike fixed-income products, ELSS can deliver market-linked returns, helping you accumulate more wealth in the long run. Why you should invest in ELSS Diversification Most of these schemes invest in different types of companies across various sectors ranging from small-cap to mid-cap to large-cap. Therefore, you can benefit from the diversification of your investment risk. Low minimum investment You may invest in ELSS for as little as INR 500, which makes it easy for you to opt for this type of fund. You may start the investment without waiting to accumulate a sizeable corpus. Systematic investment plan (SIP) You can invest a lump sum in an ELSS. However, if you do not have adequate funds, you can opt for an SIP, which allows you to invest a certain amount at periodic intervals. This helps you to inculcate financial discipline, which can benefit in wealth accumulation over a longer period. Things to consider before investing in ELSS While making an ELSS investment, here are some important things you should consider before making your decision: Lock-in period ELSS has a three-year lock-in period during which you cannot withdraw your investment. Therefore, ensuring the amount invested will not be required for this term is important. Returns ELSS is a market-linked investment product and does not offer guaranteed or assured returns. The earnings are directly based on the performance of the underlying assets. Before investing, you may check the net asset value (NAV) and performance of various funds to determine what is outperforming. Investment duration Generally, equities perform better and deliver higher returns in the long term (five years or more). Therefore, while opting for ELSS, make sure you stay invested for a longer duration to maximize the benefits and mitigate the short-term market volatility and the related risk. Fund manager and history The fund managers make all the investment decisions, and therefore, ensuring they are competent and experienced is advisable. It is also recommended you opt for funds that have delivered consistent returns over the last five or 10 years. How to invest in ELSS? You may open an ELSS account online or offline with the fund house of your choice. You can invest either as a lump sum or an SIP based on your financial situation. The minimum amount you can invest is INR 500 with no upper limit. Best ELSS Funds Top-performing funds vary based on the returns; however, some of the best ELSS funds are listed below: Fund name Three-year returns (%) Five-year returns (%) Quant Tax Plan Direct – Growth 30.29 22.71 Mirae Asset Tax Saver Fund Direct – Growth 21.02 22.03 Canara Robeco Equity Tax Saver Direct – Growth 19.91 19.05 IDFC Tax Advantage (ELSS) Direct Plan – Growth 16.98 18.00 Motilal Oswal Long Term Equity Fund Direct – Growth 14.67 17.46 SIP or lump sum: Which investment is better option? If you do not want to assume higher risk, you may opt for an SIP. This allows you to invest during different market cycles. Therefore, when the market is low, you can buy more units and vice versa, which reduces your average cost. Moreover, when the market rises, you can redeem the units for a higher price, delivering better returns. On the other hand, investing a lump sum is advisable if you want to stay invested for a longer period and are willing to assume more risk. Frequently asked questions (FAQs) What are ELSS funds? ELSS funds are diversified equity schemes that are eligible for tax benefits under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. They have a minimum lock-in period of three years. And a major portion of the corpus is invested in equity and related investments. How to invest in ELSS? To begin with, you need to complete the know-your-customer (KYC) verification. This can be done with an authorized agent, and you will need a photo, permanent account number (PAN) card, and address proof. You can then invest in your chosen scheme online or offline. How to open an ELSS account? You will have to open an account with the fund house and undergo the KYC procedure. After this, you may select the scheme you want to invest in and purchase the number of units. In this article Mutual Fund Investment Similar articles that might interest you!

However, it is also one of the most important financial decisions. Therefore, you should take your time and not rush into any decision. With the rising real estate costs, it is most likely that you may not have the entire amount required to purchase the property. Therefore, you may avail of a loan from a bank or a non-banking financial company (NBFC). What is a mortgage? A mortgage is a type of secured loan that is taken for purchasing a home, land, or other types of real estate properties. The borrowed amount is repaid over a period in regular instalments comprising principal plus interest. The property is used as collateral. Moreover, you may apply for this loan either from a bank or an NBFC. To qualify for the loan, you need to meet certain requirements, such as minimum income, credit score, and down payment. What is a mortgage loan? A mortgage loan is also a secured credit facility where you can borrow a certain amount using an existing asset as collateral. It is a popular type of financing as it allows you to borrow a higher amount for a longer period. This type of loan is usually given against an immovable asset like your home or commercial property. It is also known as a loan against property (LAP). How does a mortgage work? Such debt is often for a longer duration, such as 15, 20, or 30 years. During the loan tenure, you repay both the principal amount and the interest. Generally, the total repayment amount is divided into equated monthly instalments (EMIs), which comprise principal and interest components. Finally, at the end of the tenure, you become the owner of the property. Every month, a portion of the EMI is adjusted against principal repayment and the balance against the interest. Initially, a higher amount is towards the interest payment. As you continue paying the EMIs, a higher amount is adjusted towards the principal repayment. In case of default or delays, the lender may repossess your property and sell it to recover any outstanding dues. Types of mortgages in India There are mainly six types of mortgages in India, which are as follows: Simple mortgage You borrow the money by offering an immovable personal asset as collateral. If you fail to repay the loan amount, the lender can sell the asset to recover their dues. Mortgage by title deed deposit You deposit the title deed of the mortgaged property with the lender to avail of the loan. Usufructuary mortgage Under this structure, the possession is transferred to the lenders. They receive profits or rent from the property and this type of mortgage does not create any personal liability for you. Mortgage by conditional sale In this structure, you sell your property on the condition that it becomes effective if you default on the repayment. The agreement is void when you repay the entire amount with the interest cost. English mortgage It establishes a personal liability for you and the mortgaged asset is transferred to the lender with the condition that it will be recovered after you repay the entire due amount. Anomalous mortgage Any mortgage that does not qualify under the above-mentioned types is considered here. Mortgage payment structure The borrowed amount is repaid in monthly instalments over the loan tenure. The EMI comprises the following two components. Principal This is the loan amount disbursed by the lender at the start of the tenure. Initially, a lower portion of the EMI is used towards principal repayment. Interest Lenders levy a certain mortgage loan interest rate, which is the cost of borrowing the money. At the start of the tenure, a higher portion of the amount is used for paying the interest. However, as you regularly pay the EMIs, a larger portion is adjusted towards principal repayment. Generally, the longer the loan tenure, the higher will be the interest outflow and vice versa. Steps to find the best mortgage You need to conduct extensive research and shop around to find the best deal. Spend some time exploring different options online to compare various factors, such as loan amount, tenure, mortgage loan rates, processing fees and other charges, and terms and conditions. Here are some things you can do to find the best deal. Check your credit score and if required, take some time to improve your score to get the best deal. Know all the available options and familiarize yourself with common terms and conditions. Compare the different rates and terms offered by various lenders. Read the agreement thoroughly and check the fine print to ensure there are no surprises in the future. Useful mortgage terminologies to learn Collateral: The asset given as security to cover the loan amount. EMI: This is the monthly amount you will pay towards loan and interest payments. Tenure: It is the duration over which you repay the borrowed amount. Interest: The cost of borrowing can either be at a fixed or flexible rate. Loan to value (LTV) ratio: This is the ratio between the loan amount and the property value. Things to remember before opting for a mortgage Ensure your credit report is correct and get any anomalies rectified before applying for the loan. Determine how much loan you can afford and do your homework. Gain a preliminary understanding of how these loans work and know the common terms and conditions like interest rates, tenure, and loan amount. Check processing fees, prepayment charges, default penalties, and other costs. This type of loan can be useful to meet personal or business fund requirements. However, like all loans, you must repay them on time to avoid severe consequences and late payment charges. Take time to check out different options and make an informed decision to avoid facing any financial crises. In this article Mutual Fund Investment Similar articles that might interest you!

As such, it can invest across large, mid, or small caps based on market capitalisation. Likewise, to explore different sectors, managers of focused funds can consider investing in chemicals, information technology, finance, pharma, healthcare, etc. Some focused equity funds are small-cap funds, sectoral funds, large-cap funds, value funds, and the like. How Does a Focused Equity Fund Work? To understand how a focused equity fund works, you should first understand the purpose of such funds. Focused funds can invest in a limited number of stocks with a maximum cap of 30 stocks. So, they have a concentrated portfolio for selecting stocks within the limit of 30 stocks. However, focused funds do not restrict where to invest, implying they can invest in any company, sector, industry, or market capitalisation. For instance, fund managers have the freedom to assess how investor money gets allocated between large caps, mid-caps, and small caps companies for maximising gains from investment. Who Should Invest in a Focused Equity Fund? Focused funds offer great returns over the medium to long term. However, they entail a higher risk owing to a concentrated portfolio. So, even one wrong bet on a stock could lead to huge losses for the focused equity fund scheme or vice versa. Investors must carefully evaluate their investment priorities based on the factors below before investing in a focused equity fund: Risk appetite A focused fund is more suitable for investors with a high-risk appetite as they are more volatile than diversified mutual funds over the short to medium term. If you are willing to take high risks to generate higher returns, then you should invest in them. Investing experience A focused fund has a higher risk element as it is equity-based. So, a focused equity fund may not be the right investment vehicle to start with if you are a new investor. They are more suitable for seasoned investors who understand the risks associated with focused funds and invest accordingly. Investment horizon As focused funds are equity funds, they need a longer period of growth traction. Also, these funds invest in select stocks, which may take time to show their true potential. So, it is more suitable for investors with a long-term investment horizon of five years and beyond. Taxability of Focused Equity Fund The taxability of focused equity funds is similar to other equity mutual funds. According to the Income Tax Act of 1961, short-term capital gains tax is applicable for your investment held less than one year at the rate of 15%. Investments held for more than a year attract long-term capital gains tax at 10%, provided your total gains exceed Rs.1 lakh in a fiscal year. Benefits of Focused Equity Funds Focused equity funds come with several benefits to investors. The following are some of them: Expected higher returns Focused funds invest in select high-conviction equity stocks within the permissible limit. As such, they have more scope for generating high potential returns over the medium to long term. Freedom to invest across diversified streams Focused funds have limits only on the number of stocks to be invested. There is no limit on where the funds can invest. As such, they have complete freedom to invest across any company irrespective of market capitalisation, industry, and sector. For instance, they can split their investment based on company size giving the fund a flexible investment option. So, fund managers can easily switch between stocks based on market conditions to maximise investor returns. Likewise, they can easily select stocks from any sector of their choice, ensuring the portfolio is not restricted to any one sector. It increases the chance of gaining higher returns over time. A concentrated investment in good stocks As a focused equity fund has a limit of 30 stock investments, fund managers do considerable market research to select the best stocks, which are mainly high-conviction and quality stocks. It thus ensures that the best stocks are in the investor portfolio, increasing the chances of earning higher returns than the larger stock market. Things to evaluate before investing in a Focused Equity Fund Following is a list of things that investors must evaluate before investing in equity funds: Returns In a polarised market, a focused equity fund can give better returns than diversified funds and stock markets. A polarised market is concentrated around certain stocks that drive the market while other stocks show lacklustre growth. So, if a focused fund has stocks that drive the market, you can expect exceptional returns from the scheme. In a broad-based stock market scenario, you may not earn good returns via a Focused Fund as few stocks may not drive the market. Risk Focused funds are more concentrated in a few stocks, with a maximum of 30 stocks in a portfolio. They take big positions in select stocks. As such, these funds are not diversified, increasing the risk in focused funds. Investment term Focused funds invest in select stocks. They need time to grow and could be more volatile in the short term. They are suited for investors who have a medium or long-term investment goal. Taxability Capital gains on redemption of a focused equity fund get the same tax treatment as that of an equity fund. So, make redemptions accordingly by considering the tax factor. Fund cost While investing in a focused equity fund, evaluate its expense ratio before investing. The expense ratio indicates the cost of managing your fund by the fund house. Consider focused funds with low expense ratios, as it will increase your net returns. Fund manager expertise Evaluate the fund manager's expertise and track record while investing in a focused equity fund to gain optimum returns from your portfolio. Key Takeaways Focused equity is suitable for medium to long-term investors with a high-risk appetite and who wish to gain higher returns from a concentrated portfolio of a maximum of 30 stocks. FAQs Does a focused equity fund have a lock-in period? A focused equity fund does not have a lock-in period. So, you can redeem your investments in the fund easily whenever you want within trading hours. Are focused equity funds risky? Focused equity funds invest a particular portion in equity stocks, so are subject to stock market risk. Also, they constitute a concentrated portfolio implying increased risk because your investments are not evenly diversified. What is the investment horizon of a focused fund? Focused funds should be invested from a long-term perspective of five years and beyond to earn good yields. If you are a first-time investor, you can invest in a focused equity fund, provided you are willing to stay invested for a longer period and have a higher risk appetite for maximising your returns.

Now, it is time to start thinking of investing all the extra cash. And while you mull over your options, include this important aspect of investing while conducting your research—Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). What is CAGR? CAGR is the average annual growth rate of an investment over a certain period, typically longer than a year, assuming compound growth. You can also think of it as the rate of return that is needed for an investment to grow in value, from start to finish, all while reinvesting the profits at the end of every period of the investment’s tenure. How Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) works Calculating the arithmetic average or mean of returns has its share of limitations. CAGR helps overcome these because it provides a smoothed rate of return. It gives you a decent projection of the yields from an investment annually when compounded and can be used to assess the performance of different investments over time. Most of us are only concerned with the absolute return of our investments when we look at their performance. However, the time value of money is often ignored by us. This is how CAGR is different. In fact, the CAGR formula takes the time value of money into consideration. What is the CAGR formula? The Compound Annual Growth Rate formula is: CAGR = [(End value/ Beginning value) ^1/n – 1] x 100 Where n is the investment period Now, let us look at how it is calculated. How is CAGR calculated? From the CAGR calculation formula above, we understand that it is calculated by following these four steps. First, divide the investment value at the end of the investment period by the value of the same investment at the beginning of the period. Next, raise the subsequent result to the power of one by the number of years. Subtract one from this result. Finally, to convert the result to a percentage, multiply it by 100. With this, you have an idea as to how to calculate the CAGR for your investments. But how can you use it in your daily life? Read on. How is CAGR useful? If you have been investing for a while, you know that your rate of return is never constant. It keeps varying from one year to another. However, the CAGR helps smoothen these variations out. So, if you want to calculate how much all your investments will return over a period of years, the CAGR will assume a constant growth rate across these five years. So, now it becomes easier for you to compare or track investment growth and performance, provided you reinvest your profits every year. How do investors use CAGR? Investors can use it in the following ways. Let us look at each with an example. Compare investments Let us say that in 2015, an investor put INR 10,000 in his bank account at a 1% rate of interest and another INR 10,000 in mutual funds. Making a direct comparison between the two might be difficult considering the fluctuating rates of return from the stock market. So, the investor can make use of CAGR to understand the difference in return between the two investments. Let us assume that the investor has INR 10,150.10 in his bank account and INR 15,348.52 in his mutual fund after five years. Now, if you apply the CAGR formula, you will find that the bank account, as promised, provided a return of 1% and the stock market gave a return of 8.95%. Naturally, you might be mistaken that the mutual fund option is more lucrative; however, the CAGR does not factor in the volatility of the stock market. Find the present or future value of money The CAGR formula can be used to arrive at the initial value of an investment for it to be worth something in the future. For instance, let us say an investor needs INR 50,000 and expects a rate of return of 8%, he could find out how much he requires to save today, depending on the tenure he prefers. Identifying the right avenue for investment Using the example above, let us assume that the investor knows he needs INR 50,000 at the end of 18 years and has INR 10,000 ready for investing today. Using the CAGR calculation formula, the investor will know that the rate of return for INR 10,000 to become INR 50,000 in 18 years should be 6.90%. So, now he will look for an avenue that will give him a similar rate of return. Advantages of CAGR It is an effective tool that helps determine the profitability of investments over a certain period. Short-term CAGR takes in all factors that affect the performance of your investments, and these include market parameters too. In the long-term, it excludes all short-term fluctuations considering the possibility of your investment recovering from market variations. As a result, it is used by several investors to understand the true potential or the strengths and weaknesses of companies. Disadvantages of CAGR Like we discussed already, CAGR is not the most effective measure to determine an investment’s performance. It is only a representation. Moreover, it does not account for the fluctuations in the stock market that have a direct impact on the performance of companies. As a result of the first limitation, CAGR cannot be used to assess risk accurately. You, as an investor, might not be able to understand the performance of a security just based on the CAGR of a company because short-term variations are not factored in. So, along with CAGR, you would need to use other analytical tools to arrive at an investment decision. Example of Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) We already know that the CAGR formula is (End value/ Beginning value) ^1/n -1 x 100 Let us understand this with an example. Suppose you invested INR 2,000 in Equity Linked Saving Scheme (ELSS) for three years. The initial Net Asset Value (NAV) of your investment was INR 2,000, then it increased to INR 2,200 in the next year, and finally stood at INR 2,400 at the end of three years. So, the CAGR would be: CAGR = (2400/2000) ^⅓ - 1 x 100 = 6.27% The difference between absolute return and CAGR in mutual funds By now, you would have understood what CAGR is and how it can be useful to investors. So, do you need to use the CAGR when evaluating an investment? Well, investors use both absolute returns and the CAGR to determine the returns on investment. But there are differences between the two. When you calculate the return as a function of the initial value and the final value and do not consider the tenure of the investment, you will arrive at the absolute returns on mutual funds. The formula for absolute return is similar to the CAGR formula but it does not include the time. [(End value of the investment/ Beginning value) – 1] x 100 So, if you invest INR 2,00,000 in mutual funds and sometime in the future this amount stands at INR 6,00,000, the absolute return would be: [(6,00,000/2,00,000)-1] x 100 = 200% The absolute return is 200% but you do not know how long it could take to arrive at this return. It could be months or years. So, you can never determine the viability of an asset by simply calculating the absolute return. Moreover, it cannot be used to compare two investments. On the other hand, the CAGR can indicate the growth of an investment over a period. It smoothens out the volatility of a fund and can be followed easily. It can be used to compare two investments as well. In the previous example, we saw that the absolute return was 200%. If we were to assume that the investment matured to INR 6,00,000 in three years, we could calculate the CAGR return as [(6,00,000/2,00,000) ^⅓) – 1] x 100 = 44.22% So, you can see that the investment grew by 44.22% every year to grow into INR 6,00,000. This was the average growth each year. On the other hand, the absolute return on this investment was 200%. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) related to CAGR How to calculate the CAGR in mutual funds? Calculating CAGR in mutual funds is simple. You may calculate how a mutual fund has performed over a period by using the CAGR formula. Let’s say an investment of INR 1,50,000 grew to INR 3,25,000 in three years. The CAGR of this mutual fund would be [(3,25,000/1,50,000)^1/3) – 1] x 100 = 29.40%. Is CAGR used in banking too? Usually, in banking, it is the annual yield from your investment that is considered and not the CAGR. Yield is the amount of interest you can earn in a year on your investment. Is the IRR better or CAGR? When you are making a one-time investment, these are the same. However, the internal rate of return (IRR) is a better tool to calculate varying returns from different investments.

The debt market comprises several financial instruments that enable the borrowing and lending of funds for interest. However, since debt is safer than other asset classes, it also offers lower returns. Nonetheless, it is an ideal investment option for risk-averse individuals. What are debt funds? Debt funds are a suitable investment for those with a low appetite for risk. Here, investors put money in securities that generate a fixed income. The interest rate and the maturity period are pre-decided by the issuer, thus the name ‘fixed-income securities’. Examples of such funds are treasury bills, corporate bonds, commercial papers, and much more. How do debt funds work? Debt funds mostly work based on credit ratings. Fund managers use this factor to filter out a variety of low-quality debt securities. Higher-rated debt securities imply that the issuer is less likely to default. However, this does not mean that low-quality ones are not worthwhile. A few fund managers, with a larger risk appetite, might account for the higher returns on low-quality debt instruments and invest in them. The interest rates also influence the fund manager’s decision – they invest in long-term securities when interest rates are falling and short-term securities when interest rates are rising. Who should invest in debt funds? Debt funds are diversified across multiple securities, so returns are stable and within the expected range. Therefore, these funds are ideal for those with a low-risk tolerance. However, they can also work for investors looking for a short-term or medium-term holding for excess cash. Moreover, debt fund returns are better than bank deposit returns. Types of debt funds Debt funds can be categorised based on their maturity periods. They are as follows: Liquid fund It invests in securities that generally mature in 91 days and is an ideal short-term investment. Dynamic bond fund It is dynamic because it invests in securities with different maturity dates. It is meant for those with medium risk tolerance and an investment window of three to five years. Money market fund It invests in securities that mature within a year and is suitable for those looking for safe debt securities in the short term. Gilt fund It invests only in government-issued securities and carries a low credit risk. Thus, it is great for those with a low-risk appetite. Banking and PSU fund 80% of the assets are invested in debt securities of public sector undertakings (PSUs) and banks and these are meant for risk-averse investors. Corporate bond fund 80% percent of the assets in this fund are invested in corporate bonds. Such a fund is ideal for investors with low-risk tolerance and those who are interested in high-quality corporate bonds. Floater fund 65% of its investible corpus goes into floating rate instruments. Such funds help mitigate the risk of market volatility. There are several other types of debt funds like the overnight fund, ultra-short duration fund, low duration fund, medium duration fund, and much more.Moreover, their maturities range from one day to four years. Things to remember before investing in debt funds Risk factor Although they are among the safest securities, they carry a credit risk (of the issuer defaulting) and interest rate risk (price drop due to an increase in interest rate). No guaranteed returns Debt fund returns are not guaranteed. Moreover, the Net Asset Value (NAV) of a debt fund can fall with an increase in interest rates. Associated costs There is an expense ratio included in the investment amount. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) mandates that this percentage be 2.25% or less of the overall asset. Varying investment horizons If you want a short-term investment, you may choose to put money in liquid funds. However, if you have a longer horizon, then you may invest in dynamic bond funds and earn better returns. Taxable Capital gains from both short-term debt funds and long-term debt funds are taxable. How are debt funds taxed? Before investing, it is important to understand the debt fund taxation. All the dividends received from these funds are taxed in a classical manner since Budget 2020. The tax rate depends on the holding period. If it is shorter than three years, then the returns are called short-term capital gains (STCG) and are taxed as per the income tax slab of the investor. On the other hand, long-term capital gains (LTCG) occur when the holding period is longer than three years and are taxed at 20% after indexation. How to invest in debt mutual funds? Today, there are several third-party platforms online through which you can start to invest directly in debt mutual funds. All you need to do is register, get your know-your-customer (KYC) in order, provide your investment details, and choose from the available options. Top 10 best debt mutual funds in India Here are some of the best debt mutual funds in India.

However, when we talk about the long term, it doesn't mean you invest and forget. Since mutual funds are marketable securities, they are exposed to market risks and thus require constant monitoring. You must review your mutual fund portfolio often to ensure your investments are giving good returns. How to evaluate the performance of mutual funds? You can check the performance of your mutual funds through the following ways. #1 Link your investment with your goal: By linking your goals with your investment, you can track the progress of your investments. Estimate the money needed for your goal, and see whether your investments are helping you progress towards your goal. If not, then it's time you rethink your investment in that fund. #2 Compare with the benchmark performance: You can also check whether your fund is performing well or not by comparing it with its benchmark. A fund's benchmark is usually disclosed in the scheme information document. By comparing the fund's returns and the benchmark, you can check whether your fund is underperforming or beating the benchmark. #3 Compare with similar funds: There are several mutual fund houses, each of which has funds for different categories. So, pick up funds of a similar category from other asset management companies (AMC) and compare your fund's returns with them. If your fund is underperforming, then it's time you switch your investment from underperforming to a better one. #4 Check historical performance: Although a mutual fund's past performance doesn't guarantee future returns, it is important to check the fund's past performance. Check how the fund has performed in different cycles, and look for consistency in returns. Consistency helps understand the expertise and skill of the fund manager. #5 Check the expense ratio: The expense ratio of the fund is important while assessing the performance of a fund. Although a high expense ratio means lower returns, a fund with a high expense ratio can sometimes perform extremely well, as the manager might need additional funds for quick decision-making to capitalize on an opportunity. #6 Evaluate the risk-adjusted returns: Mutual funds come with a risk that is difficult to eliminate. However, checking whether the returns justify the risk is important. Several ratios, such as alpha, Sharpe, and information ratios, can be used to measure risk-adjusted returns. Evaluating the performance of the mutual fund isn't rocket science. However, it is a time taking process. Imagine the amount of time you have to spend to compare the performance of the fund with its benchmark or peers and estimate the risk-adjusted returns! It is a time taking process and can get demotivating to do often. This is why Jupiter came up with a free portfolio analyser tool to check the health of your performance. You can use its portfolio analyser tool even if you are not investing with Jupiter. Let's see how to use the tool and what its benefits are. How to Use Jupiter’s Free Portfolio Analyser?

You must forward that email to investments@jupiter.money. Jupiter Money will send you an insightful report about your mutual fund investments.

Quick and time-saving: The tool analyses your portfolio within seconds and saves you the effort and time you must invest in portfolio monitoring. Simple to use: The tool is simple and straightforward and doesn’t involve complex steps and processes to get the report. Helps in decision making: It helps make informed decisions by telling you your risk exposure and underperforming funds. Why should we keep checking the performance of your investments in mutual funds? You must've often come across the statement 'mutual funds are subject to market risk'. This means mutual funds are marketable securities and are exposed to market volatility. Hence it is important to analyse them before you invest in them. Once you do your analysis, you can invest in the best fund that suits you, which will help you build long-term wealth. However, this is only half of your investment journey. Once you invest, it is important that you keep monitoring the performance of the funds. This is because there are high chances that these funds can underperform in the future, harming your portfolio. Even if your funds are one of the top-performing funds in the market, you must monitor them regularly. The following are the reasons why you must check the performance of your mutual fund investments. Tracks the progress towards your goal: Experts advise investing based on their goals. It helps estimate the investment amount, find the best investment option, and monitor the progress towards the goal. So, by checking the fund's performance, you can see whether you are progressing towards your goal. If not, you can sell your investment and find a better alternative. Informed decisions: By continuously monitoring your investments, you can make informed decisions about your portfolio. For example, suppose you want to increase your investment in the existing funds. In that case, you can check which one is performing exceptionally through portfolio monitoring and increase your investment in that fund. Rebalancing portfolio: Capital markets are volatile and can change the portfolio's asset allocation. By monitoring your portfolio, you can rebalance the asset allocation whenever it exceeds your desired limit. How often should we evaluate the performance of the mutual fund? Ideally, you must evaluate the performance of your mutual fund investments every six months to one year. Analysing your portfolio daily or even monthly might not give you accurate insights. Depending on your goal and investment horizon, reviewing your portfolio once a year for long-term goals and once in six months for short-term goals is enough. With Jupiter's portfolio analyser tool, evaluating your mutual fund portfolio has become easier than ever and will hardly take any time. Different types of ‘Returns’ in mutual fund A mutual fund's performance is evaluated based on returns. Though mathematically, there is only one way to estimate the profit; there are several kinds of returns that you can use to analyse your mutual funds. Below are the different types of mutual returns. Absolute returns – It is the simplest form of return and tells by how much the investment has grown, irrespective of the time period. Annualised returns – Also known as CAGR (compound annual growth rate), this return is the average annual return of a mutual fund estimated over a period of time. Total return – The actual return you make from an investment is the total return. It considers dividends, interest, and capital gains for calculating the return from a mutual fund. Point-to-point return – It is the return from a mutual fund between two time periods. To calculate it, you must have start and end dates. Trailing return – Return from mutual funds over a period of time until the current date is trailing return. it takes into account the volatility in the net asset value (NAV) over a period of time and not just the initial and final NAV. Rolling returns – The average annual return of a fund over a short period of time is rolling returns. It helps identify the fund’s strong and poor performance in a period of time. Extended internal rate of return (XIRR) – XIRR estimates the returns from SIP (systematic investment plan). It measures the return from a mutual fund when multiple transactions are involved at different time periods. XIRR is usually calculated in Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers or Google Sheets, as it is difficult to calculate it manually. Financial ratios to evaluate mutual funds Alpha: It measures how much has the mutual fund outperformed its benchmark. It is calculated by subtracting the benchmark’s return from the fund return. A positive alpha indicates the fund has outperformed the benchmark, whereas a negative alpha indicates its performance is less than the benchmark. Beta: It measures the volatility in the fund relative to the benchmark and is often used as a measure of risk. A beta of one indicates that the fund has a similar risk as the market. If the beta is above one, it means the fund is more volatile than the market, whereas a beta less than one indicates the fund is less volatile. Portfolio turnover: It measures how many times the portfolio has been turned over in a year. A high portfolio turnover ratio indicates that the mutual fund holdings have been changed, often leading to high transaction costs. In contrast, a low portfolio turnover ratio indicates lower transaction costs and higher returns. Sharpe ratio: It is a measure of a mutual fund’s risk-adjusted returns by comparing the return against the returns of a risk-free asset. It is calculated by subtracting the risk-free return from the portfolio's return and dividing it by the standard deviation. A higher Sharpe ratio is considered better. Sortino ratio: It is a variation of the Sharpe ratio and measures the risk-adjusted returns against the risk-free asset by considering only the downside standard deviation. A higher Sortino ratio is considered good. Frequently Asked Questions How to calculate profit percentage in a mutual fund? The profit or return on mutual funds can be calculated in multiple ways. You can use absolute or annualised returns for lumpsum investments and XIRR for SIP investments to estimate the return from mutual funds. How to calculate the annual return on a mutual fund? Annual returns can be calculated by dividing the NAV of the latest date by the NAV exactly one year back and then subtracting one from it. Annual return = (Today’s NAV/Old NAV) - 1 Where can I track mutual fund performance? You can track your mutual fund's performance on the fund houses' websites. For example, you can track your investment in Aditya Birla Fund on their website. However, checking each fund’s performance at different places can be difficult. So, you can always check your portfolio's performance on the CAMS website or Jupiter's Portfolio Analyser. Which app is best for mutual fund analysis? Jupiter Money’s free portfolio analyser can be used for analysing your mutual fund portfolio. It is a very simple tool and will generate an insightful report in no time. What metrics do you use to evaluate mutual funds? To evaluate mutual funds, you have to check the fund's historical performance and compare it with the benchmark and the peers. Apart from this, you can also use risk-adjusted ratios such as the Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and information ratio. In this article Mutual Fund Investment Similar articles that might interest you!

IN THIS ARTICLE Portfolio diversification across different financial products helps mitigate investment risks. You may invest in different asset classes, such as debt, equity, gold, real estate, and others. Furthermore, you may pick from different products within the various asset classes. If you invest in equities, choosing shares of different companies with varying market capitalization and industries is a good way to diversify your portfolio. One of the available options includes index mutual funds. Wondering what are index funds? Read on to know more. What are index funds? These are mutual funds that invest the entire corpus to imitate the underlying index like the Sensex or the Nifty. These funds are passively managed and the fund managers invest in the same companies in a similar proportion that is included in the underlying index. Therefore, your returns are in line with the benchmark index. Introduction to stock exchange Before proceeding on learning more about index funds , let us understand stock exchanges. India has multiple stock exchanges but the two most popular ones include the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE). When companies are looking to expand their business, they go to these stock exchanges to raise money from the public. Some companies may be large like Reliance Industries Limited while others may be smaller like Bata. You may choose companies from different sectors and compositions. Stock exchanges have multiple categories to classify these companies to ensure investors are not confused. BSE includes the top 30 Indian companies in its S&P BSE Sensex 30. A broader index is the S&P BSE Sensex 50 comprising the top 50 Indian companies. Other indexes include the S&P BSE MidCap, S&P BSE SmallCap, S&P BSE Capital Goods, S&P BSE Healthcare, and much more. Similarly, there are various NSE indexes, such as the Nifty 50, Nifty 100, and others. You can visit the BSE and NSE websites to find a list of all these indexes. How do index funds work? While investing in these funds, you should choose from several options. Generally, most people invest in either the Nifty 50 index fund or the Sensex. Fund managers copy the composition of the benchmark index to match its performance. However, there may be a small difference between the fund performance and index due to tracking error. It is because the fund manager may not be able to buy and sell the stocks in the same proportion as comprised in the benchmark index. How to invest in index funds? Offline investing You can visit the closest branch of the asset management company (AMC) along with the following documents: Know-your-customer (KYC) documents Identity proof Permanent Account Number (PAN) card copy Passport-sized photographs Canceled check Investing through brokers You can also invest in different funds like the Nifty MidCap Index or SmallCap Index schemes via a broker. Online investing You may invest online via a reliable portal that allows you to compare different funds. In addition to reducing your efforts, investing via an online portal eliminates commission or fees paid to the broker. Once you evaluate different options, you may select the fund and estimate the future returns via an online calculator to make an informed decision. Check out this article, to understand things to consider before investing in Index funds. Who should invest in index funds? Investors with a longer investment horizon Those who do not want to constantly monitor and modify their mutual fund portfolio Individuals who have a low risk appetite but want to earn returns that are more than fixed-income products Why should you invest in index funds? Lower expense ratio Schemes like the Nifty index funds are passively managed, which means they involve less research and the team required to make investment decisions is small. Therefore, the total expense ratio (TER) is lower when compared to actively managed funds. An actively managed fund can have a TER between 1% and 2% percent whereas the TER of index schemes is between 0.2% and 0.5%. Although this may seem a small difference, the actual effect on your long-term net returns could be significant. Lesser efforts Like most people, even you may not like the idea of selecting an active fund because it requires a lot of research. Generally, you may invest in active funds based on their one-year performance and constantly change your portfolio based on this parameter. As a result, you may end up with several mutual funds and earn returns similar to the index funds. Therefore, to save your time and efforts, putting money in index mutual funds is advisable. Active funds vs. passive index funds As the name suggests, active funds are actively managed by the fund managers. It means the fund managers and their teams conduct extensive research and decide on which stocks to buy and sell. On the other hand, passive funds copy the stock composition of the underlying benchmark index, reducing the efforts of the fund managers. Things to Consider Before Investing in Index Funds Investing in index mutual funds may be less risky than large-cap funds. However, it is not completely risk-free. Before you invest in one of the several available options, here are four things to consider. Time To maximize your returns, it is recommended you invest in index funds for a longer period. It is advisable to hold your investment for at least five years to maximize the gains. And if you hold the funds for seven years, it can be more beneficial. A longer holding period ensures your investment can tide through the short-term market volatility. Since the recommended investment horizon is longer, you must not invest your contingency savings in these types of mutual funds. Index category There are several categories of index funds in India. Although there are a large number of indices on the stock exchange, index funds are available only for some of these. So, if you choose funds like Tata Index Sensex Fund, LIC MF Index Sensex Fund, or Nippon India Index Fund – Sensex Plan, you are primarily investing in the top 30 companies in India. Alternatively, if you want to invest in the top 50 Indian companies, you may choose funds that track the Nifty 50. Within this category, you can either opt for Nifty 50 Equal Weight or Nifty 50 Index. The investee companies in both these types of funds are the same but there is still a minor difference. If you choose the Nifty 50 Index, some of the investee companies get more weightage while the others have a smaller weightage. On the other hand, if you opt for Nifty 50 Equal Weightage, all the investee companies have the same weightage. The concentrated portfolio of the Nifty 50 funds carries a slightly higher risk when compared to the equally distributed portfolio of the Nifty 50 Equal Weightage Index funds. You can make the decision based on your risk appetite. Tracking error and expense ratio Some of the best index funds have lower tracking error and expense ratios. Tracking error is primarily the deviation of the fund's performance when compared to the returns delivered by the underlying benchmark index. This error arises because even though the fund managers try their best to mimic the index, there is some difference between the two. The expense ratio includes expenses like administrative costs and the lower the ratio, the higher will be your actual returns. Compared to actively managed mutual funds, the expense ratio for index funds is lower. This is because the fund managers do not need to actively analyze various stocks and make investment decisions, which reduces the time and size of the research team. Top-performing index funds in India While analyzing the performance of funds, you need to consider several parameters. As of 7 th September 2021, the five top-performing index funds are listed below: Fund Name Five-year returns (%) Three-year returns (%) Nippon India Index Fund Direct Plan – Growth 15.95 16.03 Tata Index Fund Direct Plan 15.83 15.93 ICICI Prudential Sensex Index Fund Direct Plan – Growth NA 15.93 IDFC Nifty Fund Direct Plan – Growth 15.34 15.85 HDFC Index Fund – Sensex Plan – Direct Plan – Growth 16.25 15.78 Frequently asked questions (FAQs) Is investing in index funds risky? All investments have some risk; however, investing in these funds for the long term ensures you mitigate the risks and earn stable returns. Are there any fees while investing in index funds? AMCs charge a small percent of the total value of your investment as an expense ratio; however, it is a minimal cost and varies across different funds. Where can you buy index funds? You can either buy these funds directly from the AMCs’ websites or via online portals. Alternatively, you may purchase these from the closest branch of the fund house. What’s the difference between Index funds and ETFs? Index funds are like mutual fund schemes wherein the fund managers mirror the holding based on the underlying benchmark. However, you can buy these funds only at their net asset value (NAV) determined at the end of the day. In comparison, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are listed on the stock exchanges. Therefore, you can buy or sell these at any point during trading hours. ETFs have a higher expense ratio due to trading costs like brokerage and Securities Transaction Tax (STT). Because index mutual funds are not traded and are passively managed, the expense ratio is comparatively lower than ETFs. How are index funds taxed? These funds are types of equity schemes and are taxed as other equity plans. The dividends are included in your income and taxed at your prevalent tax slab. If you redeem the units within 12 months, the gains are considered as short-term capital gains (STCG)and taxed at 15% plus cess as applicable. However, if your holding period is more than one year, the long-term capital gains (LTCG) up to INR 1 lakh are tax-exempt and profits exceeding this limit are taxed at 10% plus cess as applicable without indexation.

The money market is where short-term assets with a maturity of up to one year are traded. These assets are usually traded by institutions which can process high volume trades. These financial assets are also highly liquid. So, they are comparatively safer and are used as near substitutes for money. Wondering what are money market instruments? Read on to know everything about them. What are money market instruments? Money market instruments are unsecured debt contracts that offer a fixed rate of return, and therefore, are theoretically riskier. However, they carry a high credit rating, indicating that the issuers do not default. Money market instruments are used to fulfil large yet short-term capital needs of businesses, banks, and governments. They are preferred by borrowers (issuers) with an immediate need for capital and lenders (investors) who want to preserve their cash requirements, invest for the short term, and earn fixed returns. Some features of money market instruments are as follows: Safe : Since they are issued by businesses and popular banks, these have high credit ratings and are comparatively safer than other instruments. Liquid : Money market instruments have high liquidity because they have a short maturity period and provide fixed returns. Discount on face value : They are issued at a price lower than their face value. Higher Yields : Money market funds have the potential to provide greater returns than traditional cash equivalents like savings accounts in addition to being safe and liquid. Risk Management : Money market funds have low to moderate interest rate risk because they invest in securities with a one-year maturity or less. Since capital protection is their main priority, fund managers frequently invest in products with strong credit ratings. Money market funds therefore have a low risk profile. Steady Returns : Due to the fact that fund values do not move much in reaction to changes in the financial markets, money market funds produce returns that are almost constant across cycles of interest rate tightening and easing. Money market funds are also less volatile than the majority of fixed-income instruments due to the low credit risk. Different types of money market instruments Several types of money market instruments are available to be traded for retailers like you. A few of these are given below: Treasury bills (T-Bills) Treasury bills or T-Bills are issued by the Indian Government to fulfill its short-term obligations. They are considered the safest among the money market instruments in India with a maturity period ranging from 14 days to 1 year. They are sold at a discounted rate but their full-face value is paid at the time of maturity, thus leaving room for capital gains. Commercial papers (CPs) Commercial papers include unsecured promissory notes that are issued by reputed, large companies. Since they are not secured, they offer higher returns than T-Bills. Certificate of deposits (CDs) These are negotiable term deposits that are accepted by banks. Certificates of deposits (CDs) differ from fixed deposits (FDs) as the former are freely negotiable and are issued for huge amounts like INR 1 lakh and its multiples. Commercial bills Commercial bills are another popular instrument of the Indian money market, and they work like bills of exchange. A bill of exchange is drawn on the buyer of certain goods by the seller of those goods. When a bank accepts this bill of exchange, it is called a commercial bill. A seller, when in need of money, can get this bill discounted. Call and Notice money Sometimes, banks and other financial institutions may borrow for a very short period to manage their cash flows. Call money is the short-term borrowing or lending of funds for a day whereas notice money refers to borrowing or lending for up to 14 days without any collateral. Repurchase agreements (Repo) Repurchase agreements are commonly referred to as repo or reverse repo. These are sale agreements wherein the party selling the security agrees to repurchase it from the buyer at a later date. The purchase price also includes a rate of interest that is known as the repo rate. Repos are effective tools to raise short-term funds for the seller and provide a decent rate of return on the investment to the buyer. Banker’s Acceptance (BA) Certain individuals and organisations use a financial instrument created in the name of the bank. These are called Banker’s Acceptance. The party issuing the instrument must pay its holder a stipulated amount within a period of 30 days to 180 days. The investor’s profit is the difference between the issue price and the sale price. Differences between the stock market and the money market Here are some of the key differences between the stock market and the money market. Maturity Although stocks can be traded in the short term, they can be used effectively to generate wealth only when you stay invested for the long term. On the other hand, money market instruments have a maturity period of one year or less. Objective While stocks are typically used to fulfil long-term fund requirements, money market instruments are used to satisfy short-term needs. Instrument types The stock market consists of stocks of independently listed companies, whereas there are several types of money market instruments such as treasury bills, commercial bills, call money, and much more. Risk involved The stock market is usually a long-term investment; therefore, the risk factor is higher than money market instruments that are meant for the short term. Benefits of money market instruments Provide short-term liquidity For both sellers and buyers, they provide the advantage of liquidity because they are short-term investments. Since they are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), they also maintain the level of liquidity in the economy. Utilise idle or surplus funds better Lenders can make good investments of their idle or surplus money. The borrower also benefits by receiving quick funds for the short term. Meet working capital requirements Money market instruments are useful in helping organisations meet the demand for their working capital. Determine crucial monetary policy decisions Since they largely make up the short-term market, they also influence the interest rate in the short run. This helps highlight the state of money and banking in the country, which eventually helps the RBI take a call on long-term interest rates and future monetary policy. Pros and Cons of Money Market Instruments Pros When compared to other fixed-income securities, money market instruments are more liquid. There is no lock-in period, so investors can sell their shares at any time. A money market instrument's return rate is marginally greater than a savings account's return rate. Cons The interest rate is greater than that of savings accounts. However, the rising inflation in the economy is unrelated to the interest rate. While other financial instruments, including mutual funds, offer a superior long-term return on investment. Money market instruments are not an option if the objective of the investment is to achieve capital appreciation while outperforming inflation. What are money market funds in India?

By Jupiter Team · December 02, 2021 · 5 min read IN THIS ARTICLE The Income Tax Act, 1961 offers several deductions and exemptions that allow you to reduce your taxes. Chapter VI A of the act lists down the various deductions that help you enjoy tax benefits. These deductions are available by putting money in different types of financial instruments. Such investments reduce your taxable income and help you to save money by decreasing the tax liability. What is section 80CCC? Section 80CCC of the Income Tax Act, 1961 provides tax deductions when you invest in certain types of pension funds, which include the following. Annuity plans offered by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) Other plans offered by various insurers as specified under section 10(23AAB) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 The deductions are available when you buy a new insurance plan or renew an existing policy. Why is it important? Generally, private sector employees do not get pensions after retiring and need to plan their finances for the post-retirement years from their income. One of the available options for financial planning is to invest in pension funds. Generally, such plans have longer investment tenure and allow you to accumulate a sizeable corpus over the years. In addition to ensuring financial independence after your retirement, the annual contribution to the pension plans is eligible for tax benefits under section 80CCC of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The tax saved can be invested further to build a huge retirement corpus. Features of 80CCC You must invest in a pension plan from a fund as per the guidelines of section 10 (23AAB) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The investment amount should be paid only from your taxable income and the deduction cannot exceed total taxable income. Any proceeds like pension, interest, or bonus earned from such investments are not tax-exempt. These are added to your income and taxed at the applicable slab rate. Any lump sum received at the time of surrender of the plan (in whole or part) is also taxable as per the applicable income tax slab. Eligibility to claim deductions under section 80CCC Not every taxpayer is eligible for 80CCC deductions. Here are the eligibility criteria. Only individual Indian as well as Non-Resident Indian (NRI) taxpayers can claim the deductions. Deductions are not available to Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs), partnership firms, companies, associations, and other non-individual taxpayers. You should be earning a taxable income that is adjustable against the deductions under this section; if your annual income is less than the minimum exemption limit, there is no need for you to claim these deductions. The tax benefits are available only if you invest in specified pension funds during the financial year. The investment should be made from your taxable income and not from any other source of income. Terms and conditions of section 80CCC To ensure you claim the deductions under this section, you must note the terms and conditions mentioned below: You should not surrender the plan either in whole or part, if you do so, the surrender value is added to your income and taxed at the applicable rates. The investment must be in pension plans that pay annuity on maturity. You should put money in the specified pension funds during the financial year in which you are claiming the deductions. The pension plan should be brought from an Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI)-approved insurance company. Rebates on any investments in annuity plans before April 1, 2006, are not eligible for benefits under section 88 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Deductions are not allowed for any amount deposited before April 1, 2006. If you make an investment in an eligible annuity plan as a single contribution, deductions under this section are available only for that particular financial year. How can you claim deductions under section 80CCC? You may claim the deductions as per 80CCC limits while filing your income tax returns (ITRs). To avail of the benefits, you have to report the total amount invested in the ITR; however, the maximum deduction is capped at INR 1.50 lakhs per annum. You must remember that the benefits are available only on the amount you invest in a particular financial year. Any accrued income like bonus or interest is not tax-exempt and will be added to your income and taxed at the applicable slab rate. Difference between sections 80C and 80CCC The primary difference between 80C and 80CCC is that under the former section, you can invest in eligible financial instruments from any income and claim the benefits even if the investment source is not taxable. On the other hand, to get the benefits of the latter section, you need to invest in eligible pension funds only from your taxable income. Section 80C provides tax benefits on contributions made in life insurance premium, Public Provident Fund (PPF), National Savings Certificate (NSC), Employee Provident Fund (EPF), tax-saving fixed deposits (FDs), Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS), Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS), Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY), Unit-Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs), infrastructure bonds, principal repayment of home loans, and much more. In comparison, section 80CCC benefits are limited to investments in eligible annuity plans from IRDAI-approved insurers. Any interest, bonus, or pension received from such policies is taxable. Moreover, the amount received on surrender is also not exempt from taxes. Understanding section 10 (23AAB) Section 10 (23AAB) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 is linked to the benefits available under 80CCC income tax limits. Clause 23AAB includes the income of a fund set up by the LIC or other insurance companies on or after August 1, 1996. You should have made contributions to the policy or fund of these entities with the primary objective of earning pensions in the future. The accumulated funds when paid to you as a policyholder are added to your income and taxed at your income tax slab rate. Moreover, these are not taxable for the insurance company. The Income Tax Act, 1961 offers various sections to provide tax deductions. Now that you know the eligibility criteria and terms and conditions of section 80CCC, you may invest in eligible annuity plans offered by IRDAI-approved insurers and enjoy the tax benefits. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a pension fund under section 80CCC of the Income Tax Act, 1961? A pension fund is an investment plan that provides income during your post-retirement years. Under this section, you may claim tax deductions on the contributions made in such funds. If you invest in an insurance plan that is not a pension plan, can you still claim section 80CCC deductions? No, you cannot claim deductions under this section if you invest in an insurance plan that is not a pension plan. However, you can claim the benefits under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Premiums paid for self, spouse, dependent children, and any member of the HUF for life insurance, ULIPs, term plans, and endowment policies are eligible for section 80C tax benefits. Who is eligible to claim section 80CCC tax benefits? Benefits under this section of the Income Tax Act, 1961 are available only to individual taxpayers making contributions to any annuity plan offered by IRDAI-approved insurance companies. However, these tax deductions are not available for HUFs and other non-individual taxpayers. What are the conditions related to claiming section 80CCC tax deductions? While claiming benefits, you need to remember the following conditions. Maximum deduction during the financial year is capped at INR 1.50 lakhs. Deductions are available only on contributions made during the preceding year. If you pay for two or more years or invest in a one-time pension plan, the benefit is available only in that particular financial year and not for the subsequent years. You are eligible for tax benefits only if you contribute towards buying a new plan or renewing an existing annuity plan from the LIC of India or other IRDAI-approved insurance companies. If you exit the policy either in part or in whole, the surrender value is added to your income and taxed at the prevalent income tax slab rate. You cannot claim tax benefits on any accrued income like interest or bonus. The contribution to the eligible pension fund must be from your taxable income. Can NRIs claim section 80CCC benefits? Yes, the tax benefits under this section are available to NRIs. Can you claim tax benefits under sections 80C and 80CCC? Benefits under section 80CCC are a part of the overall section 80C deductions.

By Jupiter Team · November 30, 2021 · 5 min read IN THIS ARTICLE The government aims to reduce your tax liability by offering several exemptions and deductions through different sections under the Income Tax Act, 1961. If you plan your taxes well, these deductions and exemptions can help reduce your liability by a significant amount, especially if you are salaried. The most popular and commonly known section is 80C. It offers various deductions to help you avail of tax benefits. Moreover, section 80C has several sub-sections. In this post, we will discuss one of these, section 80CCD of the Income Tax Act, 1961. What is section 80CCD? This section provides tax deductions if you contribute to the Atal Pension Yojana (APY) or the National Pension System (NPS). Any contributions made by your employer to the NPS also qualify for deductions under this section. Why is section 80CCD important? The section 80CCD limit and provisions not only help you reduce your tax liability but also contribute towards your retirement corpus. The section is divided into two categories. Sub-section (1) relates to your contributions made towards eligible investments and sub-section (2) deals with your employer's contribution. When you regularly contribute to the eligible pension funds, you can accumulate a sizeable corpus over the long term. The money can be invested across various asset classes as per your requirements and risk appetite. On maturity, you can reinvest the corpus into an annuity plan to receive regular income post-retirement. Classification of section 80CCD For further clarification related to the deductions, this section is classified into two subsections. One of them lays down the rules associated with the available deductions for salaried and self-employed professionals. The other provides the regulations for contributions made by employers towards employees’ NPS accounts. Section 80CCD (1) Section 80CCD (1) states the rules regarding your contribution towards eligible pension schemes like NPS. The deduction is available to everyone irrespective of whether you are a government or private employee or a self-employed professional. The provisions are applicable to all Indian citizens aged between 18 and 65 years contributing to NPS. Moreover, the rules also apply to Non-Resident Indians (NRIs). The provisions under this subsection are as follows: Maximum deduction: 10% of basic salary plus dearness allowance (DA) or 10% of gross annual income For self-employed professionals, the deduction is lower from INR 1.50 lakhs or 20% of their gross annual income An amendment introduced in Budget 2015, provides an additional deduction of INR 50,000 under section 80CCD (1B) for salaried and self-employed individuals Section 80CCD (2) Sec 80CCD (2) provisions are related to investments made by employers in employees’ NPS accounts. Employers may contribute to their employees’ NPS accounts in addition to the contributions made to Public Provident Fund (PPF) and Employee Provident Fund (EPF). The company’s contribution can be equal to or more than that of its employees. However, this subsection does not apply to self-employed professionals. As per the provisions, you may avail of tax deductions of up to 10% of your salary (including basic salary and DA) or the actual employer contribution to your NPS account. Terms and conditions for claiming section 80CCD tax deductions The terms and conditions to claim 80CCD deductions are as follows: If you are salaried, the deductions are available for contributions made by you and your employer towards your NPS account. These are also available for contributions made by self-employed professionals to this scheme. Central Government employees’ deduction is capped at 14% of their salaries The deduction is 10% of your salary (basic plus DA) or 10% of gross income (if you are self-employed); the maximum limit is INR 1.50 lakhs per year. No maximum limit on the deduction for employers’ contributions. Additional deduction of INR 50,000 contributed to NPS is eligible for deduction under its sub-section (1B). Deductions claimed under this section cannot be claimed under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961; maximum deduction under both sections is capped at INR 1.50 lakhs per annum. Any benefits received from your NPS investment like monthly payouts or surrendered accounts are liable to tax as per your income tax slab rates. If you reinvest the NPS benefits in an annuity plan, you are not liable to pay any tax on that. You can claim the deductions at the end of the financial year while filing your income tax returns (ITR). Furthermore, you need to provide proof of your contributions to be eligible for these deductions. Eligibility for claiming section 80CCD deductions Salaried and self-employed individuals Indian citizens as well as NRIs Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) is not eligible for deductions Deduction under sub-section (1) is capped at INR 1 lakh; any balance contributions can be claimed under the sub-section (2) Cash or check payments are accepted as a contribution What is the National Pension System (NPS)? NPS was introduced by the Central Government to provide the benefits of an organized pension scheme to Indians. Initially, the scheme was only for government employees but later, it was made available to all eligible citizens including private-sector employees and self-employed professionals. The primary objective of NPS is to enable you to build a sizeable corpus for your post-retirement years. The investment can help you to get a fixed monthly income to sustain your lifestyle during post-retirement. Some highlights of National Pension System are listed below: Mandatory for government employees; private sector employees and self-employed professionals can make voluntary contributions. You must continue your contribution until you reach the age of 65 years. Tier 1 account is mandatory to benefit from the deductions available in the NPS section under the Income Tax Act, 1961. The minimum contribution to a Tier 1 account is INR 500 per month or INR 6,000 per annum. The minimum contribution to a Tier 2 account is INR 250 per month or INR 2,000 per year. You can invest across different asset classes, such as equity funds, debt instruments like company bonds, government bonds, and securities, and others; however, the maximum investment allocated for equities is limited to 75% of your contribution. Subject to certain conditions, you may partially withdraw up to 25% of the accumulated corpus. On maturity, you can withdraw up to 60% of the corpus and reinvest the balance in an annuity plan. Putting money in NPS can be either done automatically or actively as discussed below: Auto-investing The allocation of the amount between equity and debt is automatic based on your age as per the government rules. Auto investing can be conservative, moderate, or aggressive, which primarily determines the amount invested in equity and related instruments. Active investing If you opt for active participation, you are responsible for all the investment decisions. Based on your requirements and risk appetite, you may invest up to 75% of the amount in equity and equity-related products. However, this limit reduces by 2.50% every year once you reach the age of 50 years. Deduction for contribution to NPS The NPS 80CCD income tax deductions are divided into two sub-sections - (1) and (2) and the limits under these two are not overlapping. Combined tax savings under this section and section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 are common and capped at a maximum of INR 2 lakhs per year. The reinvested maturity benefits received from NPS are tax-exempt; however, monthly income or lump-sum payout on maturity are added to your income and taxed at the applicable income tax slab rate. Section 80CCD and its subsections relate to the tax benefits provided on contributions made to the Central Government-notified pension fund schemes. In addition to the sections mentioned above, there are other subsections under the Income Tax Act, 1961 that lay down the rules on the treatment of money, tax implications of premature withdrawals, and other terms and conditions related to your contributions into the pension fund schemes.

Stocks? SIPs? Equity mutual funds? All of us flock to these instruments with visions of supplementary income, building a retirement plan, or even achieving financial independence (a.k.a “seeing the world” or “opening my own microbrewery”). However – these instruments depend heavily on the market’s performance. And while their returns look promising, they can swing unexpectedly between ‘exciting’ and ‘worrying’. That’s why it’s important to also invest in more stable and safer items – instruments that aren’t as dependent on the market, but still hold great value in your portfolio. Instruments that have a low correlation to the market’s performance. Welcome to the world of Low Correlation Assets – we’re talking about government-issued bonds, cold gold, and even hard cash. (Account balance works too; we’re not picky about cash-stuffed mattresses). These assets don’t always boast super-high, inflation-beating returns. But during times of economic uncertainties (like right now), they are the ones that remain largely stable. Shouldn't my investment mantra be "growth growth, growth"? Yes and no. While your idea of investing is growing your wealth and consistently reaping positive returns – it’s the market that gets to crush or lift your dreams between 9:15 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. every day. The Rs. 1,000 you invested today could become Rs. 1,200 tomorrow; which could fall to Rs. 800 the day after. Consider the recent, sudden fall in the markets. It shows us how delicate investment returns can be in the face of recession and black swan events. Some of us are even witnessing a complete wipe-out of investment gains made in mutual funds over the past 3 years. Ouch! But it’s exactly during these times that low-correlation assets shine bright – they help soften such blows by serving as a safe-guard against drastic depletion of wealth during falling markets. That’s why, it’s okay to have gold locked away in a bank locker or have cash stashed away in mattresses and pillows. As long as the IT department knows about it, you’re probably doing yourself a favour. Sooo I should just go out and buy gold? Again, yes…and no. There are more options. Take Gilt Funds for instance. These are funds that invest only in debt that’s backed by a sovereign (government) guarantee. They are issued by the RBI on behalf of the government and do not invest in corporate bonds. Which means their value doesn’t depend on corporations being able to pay their debts. No points for guessing why they’re so stable. Fact is, we undervalue such assets when the markets are doing well, because their returns pale in comparison to market-linked instruments. If you’ve followed gilt funds or even gold prices over the past few years, you may feel like they have underperformed and not delivered the returns you’d want from a typical “investment.” But look at any graph now and it’s clear that they are doing better than market-related investments. The HDFC Gold Fund has surged every time the equity markets have corrected. But when the equity market was surging, the HDFC Gold fund showed a more benign (stable) performance. Then there’s the HDFC Gilt fund – which not only shows returns that are safe and steady, but a better-than-inflation return even at its worst point of entry! And that’s what makes it worth slotting such assets into your portfolio – you’re relatively covered against the impact of a recession or unforeseen market falls. GILT... FUND... EVERYTHING No! No! It’s all about balance. Talk to your financial advisor to work out how you should split your investments between risky, relatively safe and super-safe low-correlation assets. And while we can’t give you a broad suggestion for the first two, we can advise making gilt funds and gold a part of your investments. They have the advantage of not being as connected to the markets, and are thus more stable. Of course, you can also include such assets outside of your ‘investment portfolio’. Think back to our first blog about building an emergency fund . You could hold this entire amount (worth ~6 months of your salary or 10% of your portfolio, whichever is higher) purely in the form of low-correlation assets! Yes, introducing such assets into your portfolio can reduce the upside for you to a certain extent, but think of it this way: When the market is volatile (like in recent times), which asset would you want to liquidate to buy into a steadying equity market? Gold, gilt funds and government-issued bonds are fairly liquid and give you the leverage to take advantage of market lows. So while it may seem like these assets don’t offer supernormal returns, they certainly make for an important part of every portfolio. Some might even say they’re worth their weight in gold.

Here’s a 7-Point Easy Guide to Creating an Ideal Mutual Fund Portfolio for Long Term By Jupiter Team · March 18, 2023 · 10 min read IN THIS ARTICLE How to Build a Mutual Fund Portfolio? Here’s a 7-Point Guide to Creating an Ideal Mutual Fund Portfolio for Long Term Mutual funds are an excellent investment option for creating long-term wealth. They will help you meet all your goals, making you financially secure. However, you cannot invest in just one mutual fund to realise your goals. Different goals require different funds, and all these funds put together form a mutual fund portfolio. Although there is no specific rule of thumb to create a mutual fund portfolio for the long term, you can follow a few steps to create one. What is a Mutual Fund Portfolio? A mutual fund portfolio is a collection of mutual fund schemes that fit your goals, investment horizon and risk tolerance levels. You can choose to manage your portfolio or take help from a financial advisor who can help manage the portfolio for you. Although there is no ideal mutual fund portfolio that suits everybody, all portfolios must have one thing in common, which is diversification. In other words, it means you must spread your investments across mutual fund schemes across categories to spread the risk of investing. Now that the most important rule of investing is clear let's see how to create an ideal mutual fund portfolio that suits you. Strategy to Create a Mutual Fund Portfolio for Long Term There are no golden rules to creating a portfolio, but the following steps will guide you through creating an ideal mutual fund portfolio for the long term that will suit you the best. #1 Identify your goals and resources The first step towards investing is to evaluate your resources and identify your goals. Prepare a financial plan with your income and expenses. See where you can save by cutting down on unnecessary expenses. Only if you can save can you invest. Next, you have to identify your goals. What is the reason for investing, and what goals do you want to achieve by investing? How much will you need to fund your goals? By when do you want to achieve these goals? Ask yourself these three questions and write down the answers on a piece of paper. Once you answer these questions, you will have your goals, target amount, and investment horizon. Investing without a goal is travelling without a destination. You don't know where you are going. Although that's exciting for some time, in the long term, it can be exhausting. Also, only if you know your target amount and investment horizon will you know how much to start saving today and until when. Hence being aware of one’s goals is very important for any investor to invest in any asset. #2 Understand your risk-taking ability Once you've identified your goals, assessing your risk-taking ability is important. Sometimes you think you can stomach the high risk but end up panicking during unfavourable market situations. Hence it is important to understand your risk tolerance level. Factors such as your age, responsibilities, and how you perceive a market correction help determine your risk profile. You can take a risk profiling questionnaire to understand what is your risk-taking capacity. Download a risk profiling questionnaire from the internet for free to understand your risk-taking ability. But why is risk profiling important? You can identify asset classes for your portfolio based on your risk profile. Each asset class has varying levels of risk. For example, equity has the highest risk, and fixed deposits have the least risk. So, depending on your risk-taking ability, you can choose the best investments for your portfolio. #3 Determine asset allocation Determining your mutual fund portfolio allocation should be done before you decide where to invest. It is based on the asset allocation that you will determine where and how much you will put your money. There are several types of mutual funds such as equity, debt, and hybrid funds. Within equity, there are several categories, such as large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, value funds, etc. Each of them falls under different risk levels and gives different returns. Hence it is important to determine your asset allocation before you decide on your investments. You can use different asset allocation strategies, such as the 100 minus age rule or the 80-20 rule. In the 100 minus age rule, you will invest in the percentage of your assets similar to your age in debt and the rest in equity. This is because it is assumed that one can assume more risk at a younger age than when they are old. So, if you are 25 years old, you can invest 25% of your assets in debt and 75% in equity. In the 80-20 rule, you can invest 80% of your assets in equity and 20% in all the other asset classes, such as debt and gold. Each of these strategies has limitations, and it is best to determine your asset allocation strategy based on your goals. For example, for a long-term goal like retirement, you can invest all your assets in equity. For a short-term goal like buying a car, you can invest most of the assets in debt. #4 Select funds to invest After determining your mutual fund portfolio allocation, you must pick the funds for your mutual fund portfolio. When selecting funds, ensure your portfolio has a maximum of six to seven funds, as anything more than that can make your portfolio unmanageable. The fund selection must be made meticulously using both quantitative and qualitative parameters. You must check the past performance of the fund to understand the consistency in giving good returns. Then, compare it with the benchmark and peers to see by how much it has outperformed both. Apart from performance, you must check its expense ratio, portfolio turnover ratio and risk-adjusted returns such as Sharpe and Sortino ratio. The fund manager’s expertise and experience also play an important role in the performance of the fund. Use quantitative and qualitative factors to analyse the fund before selecting it as a potential candidate for your portfolio. #5 Choose your strategy You can invest in mutual funds in two ways, through SIP (systematic investment plan) or lumpsum. SIP is a facility that allows you to invest a small amount regularly for a period of time. It is best for the salaried class, who receive income monthly. Since you will invest over a period of time, you can benefit from rupee cost averaging, which will reduce your average cost per unit. You can enable auto-debit to ensure you aren’t missing out on your SIP instalment. Additionally, you can step up your SIP amount every year to beat inflation. In lumpsum investment, you will invest a certain amount once in a mutual fund and stay invested until the end of your investment horizon. Lumpsum investment is best when you have a huge sum of money. For example, salaried class bonuses and yearly incentives can be invested through the lump sum route. #6 Invest After selecting your funds and deciding your strategy, you must invest to realise your goals. You can invest through offline or online modes. For offline, you can visit the mutual fund office, submit the application form and give a cheque to start your investment journey. However, offline investing is considered time taking in the current era of digitisation. Hence you can consider investing online. You can directly visit the asset management company's website to invest, or you can go to any online platform offering mutual funds, such as Jupiter Money. Online investing is just like online shopping. You have to select the funds you want to invest in, do your digital KYC and submit your bank details, and within no time, you can become a mutual fund investor. By investing through online platforms, you can also see all your investments in one place, helping you to track your progress towards your goals. #7 Don’t stop with investing You cannot invest and forget. It is important to monitor your investments regularly to track their progress. Since mutual funds are marketable securities, you must monitor them. Today's best-performing fund might not perform well after a few years affecting your portfolio returns. Hence you must do a yearly review of your portfolio. One easy way to monitor your funds is to track the progress towards your goal. If your portfolio isn’t making enough profits for you to reach your goal, then it's time you rebalance it. Portfolio review and monitoring is a tedious process. You must check the fund's performance, compare it with peers, and benchmark. You must also check the risk-adjusted returns, expense ratio, and whether the fund manager is investing based on the objective or not. Since all this takes time, you can use an online tool such as Jupiter Money’s portfolio analyser tool to check the health of your investments. The tool will tell how your portfolio is performing with respect to the market and also suggest some funds to rebalance it, if necessary. Remember, portfolio monitoring is as important as investing, and you should never neglect it. Things to Keep in Mind When Building Your Mutual Fund Portfolio Now that you know how to build a portfolio, here are a few things you must keep in mind before starting your investing journey. Have an emergency fund: Before investing for your future, you must set aside money for uncertainties or emergencies. Since you never know when an emergency can knock on your door, it’s better to be prepared. Have an emergency fund with a minimum of 6 months of expenses. Save it in a bank or a liquid fund so you can easily withdraw it when necessary. In an emergency, you can use this fund, and you don't have to put your financial goals on hold. Understand the market: Have a basic understanding of the market. Check what investment options are available to you. Within mutual funds, you have a host of options available for different investment goals. Understand how these funds can react when the market goes up or down. You don’t have to dig deep and become a financial expert; a basic understanding is enough. Do proper research and analysis: Check which mutual funds suit you best before investing. Select a fund after checking quantitative and qualitative factors. Don’t hesitate to get help: If you lack the knowledge and time to do research and select a fund that will help you reach your financial goals, take the help of an expert. Financial advisors will help you invest in the best funds that will best suit your goals and resources. They will also monitor your investments regularly so that you can have a good night's sleep. Be disciplined and consistent: The secret behind accumulating wealth is to be consistent with investing. Although SIP helps you inculcate financial discipline, you must do your bit by saving that extra rupee. Cut down on costs wherever possible and invest before you spend. This lets you stay consistent with your investments and reach your financial goals. Frequently Asked Questions What is a good mutual fund portfolio? A good mutual fund is one that aligns well with your goals, resources, and risk tolerance levels. Selecting mutual funds based on your goals and risk-taking capacity will help you achieve your goals faster and manage your portfolio better. How many mutual funds are good in a portfolio? A portfolio should have a maximum of 6-7 funds. Anything more than that will make it difficult to manage and also lead to over-diversification, ultimately harming your portfolio returns. What is the minimum time to hold a mutual fund? There is no minimum holding period for mutual funds; you must invest depending on your investment goals and horizon. It is best to stick to your investment until you want to reach your goals. For long-term goals (more than five years), equity mutual funds are the best as they have the potential to give good returns in the long term. Invest in debt mutual funds for short-term goals (one week to three years). Which type of mutual fund is best for the long term? Equity mutual funds are the best for long-term investments. This is because they are exposed to market volatility in the short term, which can result in losses. However, the volatility smoothens out in the long term, and equity funds can give high returns. What is an ideal mutual fund portfolio? An ideal mutual fund portfolio is one that suits your goals and risk-taking capacity. It must also have a maximum of 6-7 funds to ensure adequate diversification. What is 12-20-80 asset allocation? The Quantum mutual fund gave a 12-20-80 asset allocation rule. According to the strategy, you must allocate 12 months of your expenses to liquid funds, 20% of the investable amount in gold funds and 80% to equity. How much should I allocate to a mutual fund portfolio? Ideally, you must save and invest 20% of your income. Your portfolio allocation will depend on your goals and risk appetite. Equity is the best for long-term goals and high-risk takers. For short-term goals, debt is the best. Investing 20% in equity and the rest in other assets would be ideal for risk-averse investors. Hence, depending on your needs, you must select your asset allocation. In this article Mutual Fund Investment Similar articles that might interest you!

Tax planning plays an instrumental role in deciding how much you pay to the government. If you fail to plan your taxes, you might end up paying more than you actually should. This article will give you insights on how to save tax and take advantage of the several tax deductions to lower your tax burden. What Is Income Tax? Income tax is one of the significant sources of revenue for the government. It is a type of charge that you pay on the income you earn in a financial year. The money is collected to improve the infrastructure of the country and the well-being of the citizens in general. In India, you must pay your taxes according to specific income slabs. For instance, the income tax paid by a person who earns INR 6,00,000 per annum would be different from someone who pulls in about INR 50,00,000. The Income Tax Department has decided the tax rates for each income slab as shown below: Income Slab Tax Rate < INR 2,50,000 0% INR 2,50,000 – INR 5,00,000 5% INR 5,00,000 – INR 7,50,000 10% INR 7,50,000 – INR 10,00,000 15% INR 10,00,000 – INR 12,50,000 20% INR 12,50,000 – INR 15,00,000 25% > INR 15,00,000 30% These tax slabs have been defined under the new tax regime and implemented from FY 2020-21. While calculating your tax amount, make sure that you consider any professional tax deductions that can be availed. Difference Between Old and New Tax Regime Under the old tax regime, there were only three income slabs. Even the rate of tax was higher compared to the new tax system. Income Slab Tax Rate < INR 2,50,000 0% INR 2,50,000 – INR 5,00,000 5% INR 5,00,000 – INR 10,00,000 INR 12,500 + 20% of the income above INR 5,00,000 > INR 10,00,000 INR 1,12,500 + 30% of the income above INR 10,00,000 You can move forward with the old system if you wish to do so, as you can claim most income tax deductions, including house rent allowances (HRA) and leave travel concessions. You can also claim deductions for tax-saving investments under section 80C to 80U. However, these tax deductions are not available for people who opt to pay taxes in lines with the new regime. Some income tax deductions that you can avail under the new regime include: Transport allowances for differently-abled people. Conveyance allowance received for the money spent in a conveyance that forms the part of the employment. Daily allowances to meet the regular charges incurred on the place of duty. Ways to Save Tax in India There are several tax-saving schemes that you can utilise to save some additional tax money. To understand how to reduce income tax, take a look at the options given below: Buy Life Insurance: When you buy a life insurance policy, you are obligated to pay monthly or yearly premiums. Under Section 80C, these premiums are eligible for tax deductions, i.e., you will not have to pay any taxes on the amount of premium you pay. Public Provident Fund (PPF): PPF is a saving scheme where you can keep some money aside for a tenure of 15 years. You can opt for this scheme from any bank or post office in India. The rate of interest earned on these savings changes every quarter, and the interest earned via this scheme is tax-free. Tuition Fees: The amount of money you pay as tuition fees for your kids is eligible for a tax deduction of up to INR 1,50,000 every year. Rent Receipts: If you are stationed in rental accommodation and receive HRA as part of your compensation, you can claim tax deductions on the same under Section 10 (13A). Charity: If you donate a specific part of your income to some charitable organisation or a relief fund, you can claim a tax deduction under Section 80G. Higher Education: If you take a loan to sponsor your higher education, the interest paid would be available for a tax deduction under section 80E. However, you can claim this deduction for a maximum period of 8 years. Buy a House: Buying a home not only gives you stability but also saves your tax money. If you have a taxable property and pay your home loan, you can claim a tax deduction on the interest. Also, if you are a first-time house buyer, you get an additional deduction from the taxable income of INR 50,000 on the home loan interest. Tax Saving Investment Options Under Section 80C Section 80C provides you with several investment options with which you can claim income tax deductions and save money. Under this section, you are eligible for deductions up to INR 1.5 lakhs in a financial year. The investment options are as follows: Investment Returns Lock-in Period 5-Year Bank fixed deposit 6% - 7% 5 Years National Savings Certificate 7% - 8% 5 Years Public Provident Fund (PPF) 7% - 8% 15 Years National Pension Scheme 12% - 14% Till Retirement ELSS Funds 15% to 18% 3 Years Sukanya Samriddhi Yojna 7.6% Not Applicable Senior Citizen Saving Scheme 7.4% 5 Years You can avail of these investment options to get professional tax deductions on the amount invested. Tax Saving Investment Options in India Other Than Sec 80C There are tax saving options other than 80C that you can avail of. These generally include health insurance premiums, home loan interest, etc. Medical Insurance Premium: Under Section 80D, you can claim up to INR 1,00,000 per annum for deduction if your insurance policy covers any senior citizen. If a senior citizen is not a part of the policy, you can claim medical expenditure up to INR 50,000. Interest on Home Loan: A tax deduction can be claimed for up to INR 2,00,000 per annum under Section 24. Home Loan: If you take a home loan, your taxable income is reduced as you can claim the principal loan amount up to INR 1.5 lakhs. Charity: Any charity or donation made to a relief fund or an NGO can be claimed as a deduction under 80G. Interest on Education Loan: You can get a deduction for this under section 80E. How to Plan Your Tax Saving Investments for the Year There are several ways in which you can start planning your tax-saving investments. It's best to start small and then gradually increase the number of investments. Check all your expenses and identify where you can save up some tax money like your child’s tuition fees, interest paid on education loan, home loan repayment, etc. Now, total the amount and deduct it from INR 1.5 lakhs to figure out how much can you invest. Choose an investment option that fits your appetite. For instance, you can open a PPF account to start saving. If you're not sure which investment vehicle is most suitable for you, it's wise to consult a financial planner. Tax Planning for Salaried Employees If you are a salaried employee and want to know how to save tax on your salary, follow these tips: Look into HRA exemption and submit your rent receipts in time to your employer. Check if your company can reimburse you for medical bills. Another tax benefit worth looking into is Leave Travel Allowance (LTA). Your employer can cover all travel expenses related to work, which might be included in your salary. Salaried employees need to trace these areas at the beginning of the year and start saving. Speak to your employer about restructuring your pay so that you are eligible for these tax deductions. FAQs Q. How can I save capital gain tax under Section 54? This deduction is available for long term capital assets. You are eligible for this tax break if you buy a house within one year before the date of transfer of ownership of your home or within two years after that. Q. Can I claim a deduction if I contribute to the PM Care Fund? Yes, you can claim deductions under section 80G for any charitable donation that you make. Q. Can a self-employed person claim HRA exemption? No, self-employed individuals cannot avail the HRA exemption. Only salaried employees that opt for the old tax regime are eligible for this deduction.

However, investing is tricky and has its ups and downs due to the volatile nature of the market. An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of fund that holds several profitable assets rather than only one. Income funds are a type of ETF or mutual fund that increase current income in periodic intervals. Income funds hold a variety of fixed-income securities like government and corporate bonds, dividend-paying stocks (a company’s profit share that is paid to its shareholders), and money market instruments (liquid instruments that provide fixed returns with a maturity turnover of less than a year). They do not focus on helping you earn money from selling off your investment at a higher price. Rather, they help you earn a consistent income from your investments. Money market mutual funds (MMMFs) are intended for investors looking to park their cash or cash equivalent assets for a short period. They include treasury bills, banker’s acceptance, and certificates of deposit that financial institutions like banks use to raise money for the short term. Though not as safe as cash, they are considered comparatively lower risk than other options. The biggest advantage of investing in these income funds is their liquidity. You can sell them anytime as there is no fixed investment period. However, they are not suitable for long-term investments. Who Should Invest in Income Funds? Income fund investment yields return by compounding over a certain period. The change in interest rates and the investment period considerably affects its gains. This makes income funds a suitable option for those willing to take high risks and those just looking to amplify their retirement income. Income funds, as the name suggests, help generate income from investments. People with a regular income prefer income funds as a viable retirement option. Income funds are more of an added source of income for some. Benefits of Investing in Income Funds For all the right reasons, income funds have emerged as a popular choice among investors. Some benefits of investing in income funds are as follows: · Lower Risk There is a considerable risk in every form of investment. If you invest in income funds, you will lose some money if the credit rating goes down or the interest rates drop. However, income funds invest in a combination of bond funds and equity funds. There is a higher risk component in equity income funds. Government bonds or corporate bonds with high credit ratings are one of the most secure forms of investment. They carry a sovereign guarantee, meaning the issuing body is liable to repay the money as per the stipulated terms since the government issued them. · High Liquidity Unlike fixed-income instruments, income funds can also be invested in the short term. However, you will see better returns in a longer investment period. The fund managers actively look for opportunities to sell income funds and optimise the returns. In such scenarios, income funds generate a higher profit than bank deposits. · Better Returns over a Longer Period Since income funds generate lower returns than equity funds, it is recommended that you lock in the money for a longer period. A longer investment period generates a much higher return. However, income funds allow you to choose your desired investment period. · Tax Benefit Unlike bank fixed deposits, debt bonds are not taxed every year. If you are in the highest tax bracket, you will save some money on tax as long-term capital gains up to Rs. 1 Lakh are tax-free. If equities are sold before a year, and the capital gain is more than 1 lakh rupees, you will be taxed 15% plus 4% cess. · Diversification Income fund managers invest in a variety of fixed-income instruments. Some of these, like government bonds, cannot be purchased by retail investors. You will need the help of fund managers, who act as a medium to issue these bonds. A diversified portfolio lowers the market risk significantly. Fees and Charges of Income Funds Fund houses charge a small percentage of money from your investments to pay their employees and cover other investor purchases, redemption charges, and exchange costs. These are called ‘Shareholder fees’ and are always mentioned in the fund’s prospectus. But, most fund houses have their assets to take care of their expenses. While they do not charge investors directly for this, you will pay a certain portion of this money under the section ‘Annual Fund Operating Expenses.’ ‘Annual Fund Operating Expenses’ cover management costs, distribution charges, and other expenses. Different fund houses charge different amounts of money. The expense ratio may seem like a small percentage of money at the beginning, but over time, the compound interest effect will take away a significant portion of your profits. You can directly invest in mutual funds through online investment platforms if you do not want to pay for these commissions. Working of Income Funds An income fund is an asset allocation fund that provides income from investments. Fund managers invest in companies that return their profits in cash to the issuer. It is different from growth funds in the respect that growth funds re-invest the generated profits to grow their pool of capital. Even so, the accumulated funds in income funds generate returns due to the compounding effect over an investment period. The value of income funds is regulated by interest rates and credit ratings. The share prices of income funds fall when interest rates rise and vice versa. When choosing income funds, you should focus on investment-grade income funds. Investment-grade ratings are a system of qualifiers that determine whether a bond is at low risk of default. These credit ratings express a futuristic outlook on an entity’s capability to meet its financial commitments as and when they are due. AAA is the highest credit rating that can be assigned to an issuer’s bonds. Conclusion Income funds are popular mutual funds that can generate consistent monthly revenue for their investors. However, it maximises the current income. It is subject to interest rate and market risk. The two key factors that you must zero in on are the risk level and expense ratio of a fund.

TDS on salary is deducted by the employers on your taxable earnings. Moreover, TDS on salary ensures the government collects the income tax from the source itself. What is section 192 of Income Tax Act? Section 192 of Income Tax Act, 1961 relates to TDS on salary earnings. Your employer deducts the applicable TDS from your salary. The company is responsible to deduct the accurate TDS based on your taxable income and tax rate for the relevant financial year. Your employer provides Form 16, which shows the TDS deducted after the end of the financial year. Who can deduct TDS under section 192? As per the provisions of Sec 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, employers must deduct the applicable TDS. Employers include the following. Individuals Local authorities Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) Association of Persons (AOPs) or Body of Individuals (BOIs) Partnership firms Co-operative societies Trusts Companies (public and private) Every artificial judicial person. The presence of an employer-employee relationship is mandatory as per the provisions of this section. However, the employer status and the number of employees do not matter while calculating and deducting the applicable TDS. When is TDS deducted under section 192? Employers must deduct the TDS and deposit it into the government account.  As per the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961, employers must deduct the TDS when the salary is paid and not when it accrues. Moreover, TDS is deducted if your employer pays an salary advance or if you receive past arrears. Further, the employer must deduct TDS on salary even if the employee does not provide their Permanent Account Number (PAN) details and the income from salary exceeds the basic exemption limit. If your estimated salary income is less than the basic exemption limit, the employer will not deduct TDS. The following are the exemption limits when TDS is not applicable. Indian residents who are less than 60 years: INR 2.50 lakhs Senior citizens between 60 and 80 years: INR 3 lakhs Super senior citizens who are over 80 years old: INR 5 lakhs What is the rate of tax deduction under section 192? As per the provisions of section 192, TDS is deducted as per your income tax slab and the applicable rates relevant to the financial year. The employer calculates the taxable income after considering the various exemptions and deductions available as per the various sections of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The TDS is then deducted as per the income tax slab rate. Your employer calculates the estimated tax at the start of the financial year. The TDS is then determined by dividing the approximate tax liability for the year by 12 (based on the assumption that you will continue working in the company for the entire duration during the financial year). Moreover, if you do not provide your PAN details, your employer will deduct TDS at the rate of 20%. Any deficit or excess due to earlier deductions can be adjusted by enhancing or reducing the subsequent deductions during the remaining period of the financial year. If you have paid any advance tax, it can be also adjusted against the TDS. Furthermore, you must inform your employer at the beginning of the financial year if you will continue with the old tax regime or opt for the new tax regime. If you select the latter, it ensures your employer calculates and deducts the accurate TDS as per the new regime. What is section 192A and why is TDS important? Section 192A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 covers TDS on withdrawals made from provident funds. If the PAN card is submitted, TDS is at 10%; however, if you submit Form 15G or Form 15H, TDS is not deducted. Employers calculate the estimated tax liability at the start of the financial year based on your salary and other factors. The TDS is then deducted each month from your salary and deposited in the government account. This helps the government collect the tax from the source directly and reduces the chance of any missed payments. TDS is deducted from your salary every month when it is paid. This helps in budgeting since you know the exact amount you will receive in hand, which enables you to plan your finances well. Additionally, a proportionate amount is deducted each month, thus, you do not have to pay a huge lump sum at the end of the financial year. Therefore, your burden is reduced and regular deductions ensure you do not face any liquidity crunch at the end of the year. How to calculate TDS on salary? To calculate TDS on salary, the following points need to be considered. If you provide details from other earnings like rental income, your employer will include it in the TDS calculation. If you submit Form 12BB, interest on a home loan of up to INR 2 lakhs paid during the year is deducted from your salary. If you invest in any tax-saving products, you must provide proof of such investments, which reduces your taxable income and the applicable TDS. Here is an example for understanding the calculation. Assume that your annual salary is INR 12 lakhs. The TDS estimation is as follows: Annual salary 12,00,000 Less: Standard deduction 50,000 Gross total income 11,50,000 Less: Chapter VI A deductions (Section 80C) 1,50,000 Total taxable income 10,00,000 Tax liability 1,17,000 TDS per month 9,750 However, if you opt for the new tax regime, the tax liability is INR 119,800 and the monthly TDS will be INR 9,983. How is TDS deducted in the case of two or more employers? Job change during the financial year You may change your job during the financial year, which means you will earn a salary from two employers. In this case, you must submit Form 12B to your new employer to ensure they deduct the appropriate TDS. The new company considers the TDS deducted by your previous employer to determine the amount for the remaining period during the year. Employed with two or more companies simultaneously If you work with more than one company simultaneously during the financial year, you must submit Form 12B to any one employer. And one of the companies must then deduct the applicable TDS payable on the total salaries received from all employers. The standard deduction for salaried employees in income tax The standard deduction available to salaried individuals has been increased to INR 50,000 per year, which reduces their taxable income. However, the higher standard deduction replaces the medical reimbursement and transport allowance benefits that were previously available. TDS calculation in case salary is payable in foreign currency The foreign currency salary is converted into Indian Rupees. The conversion is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate as on the last day of the preceding month when salary is due or is paid in advance, or arrears . For example, if the salary is paid in January 2022, the exchange rate as of 31st December 2021 is used. Once the foreign salary is converted to Indian Rupees, the standard procedure to determine the TDS is followed. What is the time limit to deposit tax under section 192? Employers must deposit the TDS with the government within a specified time limit, which is as follows: Amount deducted between April and February of the financial year: 7th of the subsequent month Amount deducted for March: on or before 30th April Difference between section 194A and section 192 Section 194A relates to the provisions of TDS on interest other than that on securities. TDS under this section has to be deducted if interest is paid to a resident. These provisions do not apply to interest paid to non-residents, which is governed by section 195. On the other hand, section 192 relates to the TDS deducted by employers on the salary paid to the employees at the time of payment. TDS is deducted even if the salary is paid in advance or as arrears. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is section 192 of Income Tax Act? Employers deduct TDS on salary paid to employees as per the provisions of this section of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Is TDS deducted every month? According to the rules, TDS is deducted when salary is paid. Therefore, it is deducted every month if your salary income exceeds the basic exemption limit. How many types of TDS certificates are there? TDS certificates are of two types, which include Form 16 and Form 16A. The former is issued by the employers and reflects the TDS deductions made during the year. The latter shows TDS deductions on income other than salary. How is TDS on salary determined? There is no specific rate at which TDS is calculated. The tax liability is determined as per the applicable income tax slab rate for the relevant financial year.

Wondering what are mutual funds? We have got you covered. This type of investment is made by Asset Management Companies (AMCs). They collect money from institutional and individual investors and put it in different securities. These companies have experienced fund managers who invest the money on your behalf to generate returns as per your goal. A mutual fund is one of the best investment products in India to beat inflation. What is inflation? Before you start investing in mutual funds, it is important to understand how inflation affects your corpus. Inflation is the increase in the cost of services and goods over a period. The inflation rate in India is around 5%, which is higher than the interest rate offered by banks. So, the interest earned from your savings account is not enough to fight inflation. But you can manage it by investing in the right types of mutual funds based on your financial objectives. Tips for investing in mutual funds Before you start investing in these funds, you must determine your financial goal and understand the different types of options available. Here are some tips that will help you get an idea about how to go about with mutual fund investments. 1.  Defining your investment goal It always helps to put money in mutual funds with a clear investment goal. The fund managers invest your money in either equity or debt funds, based on your financial objective. If you want to create a retirement fund or buy a house, you need to stay invested in equity-based instruments for over an extended period. To achieve your short-term goals, debt-based investment options should suffice. 2.  Achieving long-term objectives When you invest in equity mutual funds to achieve long-term goals, the fund managers buy shares of different companies with your capital. There are four types of equity mutual funds—large cap, mid cap, small cap, and multicap. Large cap : This type of fund generally invests in the top 100 companies in terms of their market share. Some of these companies are Reliance Industries Limited, Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), and more. The large-cap funds have offered 7% to 8% returns over the last five years. As these blue-chip companies have almost no possibilities of going bankrupt, your investment will be safe. Suppose you have 30 years left until retirement and want to accumulate a decent amount of wealth, investing in the large-cap mutual funds in India can help. If you start putting ₹30,000 a month in these funds, your total investment at the end of 30 years will be ₹1.08 crores. If the fund offers 8% interest, it will generate a profit of ₹3.42 crores by that time. So, the total fund value will be ₹4.50 crores. Similarly, if you wish to buy a house, you need to invest ₹41,000 every month to accumulate ₹75 lakhs in 10 years from large-cap mutual funds. Mid cap : These mutual funds invest in mid-sized companies like Voltas, Bata, supermarkets, and others. In the last five years, these companies have offered 11% to 12% returns on investment. These mutual funds can help you generate significant returns, but they also expose you to high risk. If you use the same example as above, by investing in mid-cap mutual funds with 11% returns, you can accumulate a retirement fund of ₹8.50 crores in 30 years. And, for buying a house, you need to invest ₹34,500 a month for 10 years to accrue ₹75 lakhs. Small cap : A small-cap fund buys shares of companies that have a market capitalization of less than 500 crores. In the last five years, they have offered returns at a rate of 14% to 15%; however, they entail high risk. By investing in these funds, you can create a retirement fund of around ₹21 crores in 30 years based on the above example. And to accumulate ₹75 lakhs for buying a house in 10 years, investing a monthly amount of ₹27,000 in small-cap funds should be enough. Multicap : These funds invest in shares of the different large, medium, and small companies to diversify your portfolio. Their returns are like mid-cap funds, but the risk is comparatively lower due to diversification. 3.  Achieving short-term goals If you have short-term investment goals and do not want to take high risk, a large-cap fund/mid-cap fund is not for you. A debt-based mutual fund is best suited for investment goals shorter than five years. These funds invest in securities like government bonds, commercial papers, and treasury bills. These are fixed-income options that offer pre-determined interest and are not affected by market volatility. There are around 16 types of low-risk debt mutual funds. We have detailed the two primary ones. Liquid funds : Liquid funds are great savings options as they allow you to withdraw money at any time. These funds offer a 7% to 8% interest rate, making them much better than bank savings accounts. It is excellent for accumulating a small fund to meet short-term goals, like a Europe trip. If you invest ₹10,000 every month for two years in a liquid mutual fund offering a 7.5% interest rate, you will get a return of ₹2.60 lakhs. And this amount is more than enough for the trip. Dynamic bond fund : Suppose you want to buy a good car in five years, a dynamic bond fund can help you achieve that goal. It is a low-risk investment avenue that offers 8% to 9% interest. So, if you invest ₹15,000 a month for five years, you will have a total of ₹11.40 lakhs at the end of the term. List of best mutual funds to invest for beginners Many Indian AMCs offer mutual funds. Presently, some of the best options for beginners are as follows: Axis Long Term Equity Fund Aditya Birla Mutual Funds HDFC Mutual Funds Mirae Asset Large-Cap Fund SBI Bluechip Fund Axis Focused 25 Fund SBI Focused Equity Fund Tax-saving mutual funds in India Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) is the only equity mutual fund in India that offers tax benefits. ELSS mutual funds offer high returns of approximately 10% to 11% and have a lock-in period of only three years. Your investment in ELSS is tax-deductible up to ₹1.50 lakhs annually under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Things to consider before investing in mutual funds 1. Fund’s track record Before choosing a fund, conduct thorough research online to get an idea about how it has performed over the last few years. This will help you determine which fund can offer you the best returns. 2. Fund manager Not all fund managers can perform equally. So, it is advisable to check who your fund manager is and how they have performed in the past. Only professionally experienced fund managers can get you the expected result. 3. Exit load The exit load is a fee that the AMCs charge when you close the account early. They levy it to encourage you to stay invested for an extended period. A high exit load will lower your profits. 4. Expense ratio AMCs charge you the expense ratio to manage your investments. They use the fee to meet expenses like the fund manager’s salary. Before investing in a mutual fund, check its expense ratio. The lower it is, the higher will be your return. Mutual fund schemes come in different types with various benefits, interest rates, charges, and regulations. So, you must compare different options to find a mutual fund that best suits your requirements. In this article Mutual Fund Investment , FinForAll By Jupiter Similar articles that might interest you!

Its effects are still evident, with major companies like LIC, Ola, Bajaj Energy, and Delhivery expected to issue IPOs in 2022. However, the initial enthusiasm has been replaced by wariness amongst consumers, with the stock prices of companies such as One97 Communication (the parent company of Paytm) and Nykaa falling after their initial launch. Therefore, investors have been seeking other opportunities that allow them to make investments at the entry-level itself. NFOs have emerged as exciting alternatives, but there is immense confusion about their offer. We are here to clarify these matters for you and help you make smarter investment decisions! If you have ever wondered what an IPO stock or IPO investment is, this article should help you understand an Initial Public Offering (IPO) and how it differs from a New Fund Offering. What is an Initial Public Offering? While Initial Public Offerings have been a significant trend in the market for the past year, there is still a limited understanding. IPO is a process undertaken by a company to raise funds for its business to grow further. Once these IPOs enter the market, they are traded on the stock exchange in India. IPOs fundamentally change the structure of any organisation as it transitions from being private to publicly owned, thus influencing all significant decisions ahead. IPOs are an excellent opportunity for investors to become parts of companies with immense potential value. If you seek short-term profits and immediate gratification, you may choose to sell your IPO as soon as it starts trading in the market if it has made a splash upon opening. In contrast, if you genuinely believe in a company's potential, you may hold on to your investment so that as the company’s value grows over time, so does your stock. Do you believe that a company will show promising growth immediately upon entering the market? Then applying for an IPO might be the right option. Do you think the company may have a sluggish start but is a worthy option in the long run? IPOs may be your solution. What is a New Fund Offering? One can easily get confused between IPOs and NFOs. An easy way to distinguish them is that while Private companies introduce iPOs, NFOs stand for New Fund Offerings issued by Asset Management Companies to launch new schemes. These NFOs are essentially the launch of new mutual fund schemes, and the money gathered through the NFO is used to buy securities like bonds and equity. Once the initial issue is completed, investors can opt to purchase fund units at the current Net Asset Value (NAV). Moreover, people who opted for the NFOs enjoy promising gains upon the mutual fund being listed in the market. How do IPOs and NFOs function? IPOs and NFOs have a few key differences that dictate how they function. The purpose of each investment option is different. Companies usually opt for IPOs to get the funds to grow further. AMCs launch an NFO to provide a new mutual fund investment option. It raises funds needed to acquire securities and launch the mutual fund into the market. Difference Between IPOs and NFOs Diving deeper into the dissimilarities between IPOs and NFOs can help you understand what might be the wiser investment option for you. While both allow you to make investments at the inception stage, their immediate and long-term impact, crucial factors, and probability of returns differ. Here is a quick guide to help you differentiate between the two. Understanding Terminologies Such as Mutual Fund Units and NFO Periods While this may not directly impact your investments, it is crucial to know the terminologies used in NFOs and IPOs. A single unit of an IPO is popularly known as a share. The number of shares you get determines a mix of the multiples set by the company and each share’s price. The single unit in your mutual fund is called a fund unit. You can decide on the number of fund units to apply for, and they shall all be invested purely in the assets considered best suited by the fund house. Similarly, an NFO period is the number of days available to apply for an NFO. This usually differs between equity and debt funds. Risk Assessment With IPOs, the actual value of your investment will be determined once it enters the market. Once exposed to the stock market, you have no control over how your stocks will be valued. Therefore, you need to study the company’s history, the eagerness in the market for the shares, and the expected behaviour of the stock. With NFOs, you will not know the exact assets your funds will be allocated to or have a performance history of that particular mutual fund. Therefore, it will become critical for you to understand the fund house’s reputation, the fund’s objective, and the theme that this particular NFO may be targeting. Initial Offering IPOs, even though not in the market yet, can only be applied for through established stock exchanges. This ensures fairness in the allocation and distribution and connects to the rest of your stock portfolio. NFOs are available for the public on the fund houses’ websites and can be applied directly. Pricing The price of the IPO is determined by the issuing company itself, depending on the attractiveness of the valuation and the organisation’s fundamentals. NFOs are usually priced at a face value of INR 10. Therefore, IPO prices are dictated by the issuing company itself, whereas NFOs are generally kept at the same price, irrespective of the fund house involved. Listing Price Upon the completion of the IPO period, the price of the shares at which they will be listed and traded on the stock market will be determined by the assessment of other traders and the perception of the company’s promise. When it comes to NFOs, the Net Asset Value of the scheme is dictated by the value of the securities currently present in the portfolio. NFO vs IPO: Which Is the Better Investment Option? Your goals and the market conditions decide the better investment. When it comes to immediate returns, an IPO might be wiser if there is immense excitement in the market and it has already been oversubscribed many times over. NFOs often provide promising returns, but it depends on the assets present in the mutual fund scheme at the end of the day. So, if you see tremendous excitement over an IPO, you might want to look at the buzz and understand if it is all conjecture or if there is real potential. Similarly, if you wish to stay invested in a company in the long run, a slight dip at the beginning will not affect the long-term growth of your chosen stock. NFOs are an excellent option for you if you wish to invest in mutual funds but want a cheaper option than the ones in the market. The returns on your investments will be uncertain, and you must understand the risks involved and the fund’s objectives. NFOs may also come with lock-in periods, while stocks can be traded on the market. Things to Keep in Mind Before Investing in IPOs The Company’s Business Model and Focus Before you invest in an IPO, have a clear understanding of the company’s business model and its revenue generation strategy. This is the essential information and will provide you with knowledge of the company’s stability, its liquidity situation, and position in the industry. Market Share and Growth Metrics In a market growing as aggressively as India, it is important to identify companies that offer a strong growth trajectory ahead. It would also be helpful to subscribe to IPOs that value the company issue richly. Volume of Application IPOs are considered a reliable investment option and have gained immense popularity. Oversubscriptions are bound to happen in such a case, reflecting the eagerness for the shares and the probability of you securing an allotment.

Firstly, to know much you weigh and second, to know how much you should reduce to reach your target weight. Throughout your weight loss journey, apart from eating right and exercising, you will also track your progress by checking your weight once or twice weekly. If you are on track to reach your goal, you will continue with the same food and exercise, if you feel you aren’t reducing, you end up changing your diet and workout schedule. The same works with mutual fund investments as well. Even though you invest for the long term, you must track the progress. Only then will you know whether your investments are performing well or not. If they aren't, you can replace the underperforming funds with better ones. You can do the mutual fund tracking by yourself, take the help of a financial advisor, or use a mutual fund portfolio tracker. Read to find out more about how to track your mutual fund investments. How To Track My Mutual Fund Investments? There are multiple ways to track your mutual funds, and the following are the most popular ones. 1. Online Portfolio Trackers An online portfolio tracker is a tool that will help track the progress of your mutual fund investments. Several platforms have built online tracking tools which can do more than just tracking. They even suggest better funds in case any fund is underperforming. One such tool is the Jupiter Portfolio Analyser . It tells how ‘sahi’ are your mutual fund investments. You need not invest with Jupiter Money to track your mutual funds using this tool. The best part is that it is absolutely free of cost. All you have to do is, enter your email ID in the tool, and it will automatically send CAS to your email ID. You have to forward that email to investments@jupiter.money, and it will send an insightful report to your email, completely free of cost. The report talks about the health of your mutual funds. It compares it with the NIFTY 50 index and tells how your portfolio performed against it. The tool also tells the sector and equity mix. Additionally, it gives insights on any hidden fees that you can avoid paying, identifies underperforming funds, and detects exposure to high risk. Hence it is best to use an online tracker to track the performance of your mutual fund portfolio. 2. Mutual Fund Fact Sheet A mutual fund fact sheet is a one-page document with an overview of mutual fund schemes with special emphasis on the portfolio and the performance. It is similar to a report card but for mutual funds and indicates the health of the fund. Asset management companies (AMCs) release mutual fund fact sheets monthly, which are available on AMC's website. The fact sheet is a great starting point if you want to start tracking your mutual fund performance. It provides the following information. Key information about the scheme: It includes general information about the scheme such as name, objective, expense ratio, fund manager and his expertise, assets under management (AUM), net asset value (NAV), portfolio turnover, and modified duration (for debt funds) Portfolio data: The portfolio of mutual funds may vary based on market movements. Hence, it is important that AMC discloses the portfolio every month. In the fact sheet, the AMC declares the investment details, i.e., where the fund invests the money. It also has details about asset allocation by sector or by the rating of debt securities. Volatility measures: Since mutual funds are subject to market risk, it is important to check the risk-adjusted returns and other volatility measures. Some of the volatility measures given in the fact sheet are the Sharpe ratio, standard deviation, beta, modified duration, tracking error, and portfolio yield. Fund performance: The fact sheet includes data regarding the mutual fund returns and SIP (systematic investment plan) returns. It also compares the returns with the benchmark and tells whether the fund has outperformed the market index. It is in this section that you will know how the fund has performed in the previous month. 3. Investment Advisor If you’ve invested in mutual funds through an investment advisor, you can ask them to track your mutual fund portfolio to make the most of your investments. 4. Consolidated account statement (CAS) CAS is a consolidated statement of all financial transactions in a month done under the same PAN (permanent account number) across fund houses and folios. It is sent by CDSL (Central Depository Services Limited) or NSDL (National Securities Depository Limited) to the registered email IDs. You don't have to wait for a month to get the statement; you can get it online by visiting the CAMS website . You can follow the steps below to get a statement. Go to the CAMS website and click on MF investors. Then click on ‘Statements’ and select ‘CAS – CAMS’ to get a consolidated view of your mutual funds across RTAs (registrars and transfer agents). Next, enter your registered email ID and provide a password for the document. An email will be sent to your email ID. To open the document, enter the same password to access your CAS. 5. Asset Management Company Website or Mobile App You can view the performance of your mutual funds by logging into the website or app of the fund house. For example, if you've invested in Aditya Birla mutual fund, you can log in to their portal to track the performance of your fund. However, if you've invested in mutual funds or multiple AMCs, this method can be time-consuming. Hence it is better to use an online portfolio tracker, which will display all your mutual fund investments in one place. Why should you track your mutual fund investments? Mutual funds are marketable securities. Hence their performance keeps differing based on market conditions. Therefore, it is important to track their performance regularly. Following are some of the reasons why you must track your mutual fund portfolio. Tracks goal progress: Since you will invest based on goals, tracking the progress towards your goals is easy by tracking your mutual fund’s performance. If you aren’t earning enough returns to meet your goals, then you can change your portfolio. Informed decisions: By tracking your portfolio’s performance, you can make informed decisions regarding it. You can increase or decrease your investment in a fund based on its performance. Rebalancing: Market volatility changes the asset allocation of your portfolio. By tracking the portfolio, you can rebalance it to the desired asset allocation. Frequently Asked Questions How do I track my mutual fund portfolio? You can track the performance of your mutual fund portfolio through CAS or online mutual fund portfolio trackers. What is the best free portfolio tracker? The best portfolio tracker is the one that not only tracks the portfolio but also gives useful insights about the expense ratio, risk, and diversification.

But one of the most prominent challenges of investment for beginners is deciding where to put their hard-earned money in. Mutual funds are one of the most popular investment products in India. Wondering what are mutual funds? This article aims to explain that in simple terms for new investors. What is a mutual fund? A mutual fund is a financial product offered by Asset Management Companies (AMCs). It is a pool of money put by multiple investors with a similar goal. Professional fund managers invest this money in stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments to generate returns. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulates mutual funds, but the AMCs make investment decisions. It is one of the easiest investment options in the country as experienced fund managers decide where to invest the money, freeing you of worries. How did mutual funds become popular? Mutual funds have gained popularity even among the most inexperienced investors as they enable earning profits from the financial market. These funds also allow you to diversify your money between different avenues to spread out the risk. Another reason mutual funds are popular is that they come in different types, offering various benefits, interest rates, and risk profiles. You may choose an option depending on your investment goal. Most AMCs also allow you to invest in mutual funds online, ensuring easy accessibility. So, their popularity among young investors is growing exponentially. Myths around mutual funds Most investment options have some myths surrounding them that can discourage people, and mutual funds are no different. Here are the common misconceptions about mutual funds you should know. Mutual funds are risky : There are varied types of mutual funds that are fundamentally different in terms of return and risk. Not all mutual funds are equally risky. So, you may choose as per your risk appetite. High-rated funds offer the best returns : Mutual fund ratings are based on their past performances. Although the rating provides you with some idea about the fund, it does not guarantee profits. So, it is advisable to diversify your mutual fund investments. Mutual funds are for the rich : The is one of the biggest myths surrounding mutual funds. You may choose from different apps and websites to start investing online even with ₹100! Types of mutual funds 1.  Debt funds If you want a low-risk investment option, you must choose debt funds. When you invest in these, the fund managers use your money to provide loans to the government and companies. Liquid and ultra-low duration funds are two options that offer loans for a very short time. 2. Equity funds The equity-based mutual funds invest in company stocks. The fund managers buy shares of well-performing companies and monitor them closely to decide when to sell or purchase further. Equity fund performance depends on the financial market’s ups and downs. So, they can be risky options. But, if you invest in these funds for an extended period, it averages out the risks. 3. Active vs. passive funds Active equity funds are the ones that have dedicated fund managers deciding which stocks to buy or sell. You need to pay a fund management fee for the service. On the other hand, passive equity funds do not have any fund managers. They automatically buy stocks of companies listed under the Nifty50 and Sensex indexes. You do not have to pay any additional fee to invest in passive funds. 4. Large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap funds Large-cap funds invest money only in big, well-established companies. These funds entail low risk and offer stable returns. Mid-cap funds buy stocks of medium-sized companies that have brand recognition but still are not as big as blue-chip firms. Investing in these funds can be relatively risky, but the return is high. On the other hand, a small-cap fund invests in new, small companies. They have the potential to generate high profits, but the risk quotient is much higher than large-cap funds/mid-cap funds. 5.  Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) ELSS is a tax-saving mutual fund that diversifies your investment into stocks of large, medium, and small companies. Your investment in ELSS stays locked for three years, and withdrawing the funds before that requires you to pay an exit load. One of the benefits of investing in ELSS mutual funds is that they offer tax benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Importance of fund managers in mutual funds Fund managers handle your money and invest it in suitable financial instruments on your behalf. They are experienced professionals who ensure the maximum possible returns while managing risks. Fund managers have in-depth knowledge of the financial market that helps them decide which stocks to invest in, and when to buy or sell them. What is a mutual fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) When you put money in mutual funds, the AMCs assign a fixed number of shares or units to you. The number of units you have depends on your invested amount. The mutual fund NAV is the value of each of these units. If you know the NAV, you can easily track the fund’s performance. Long-term and short-term capital gains taxes on mutual funds Your investments in equity mutual funds attract capital gains tax based on specific regulations. If you stay invested in the fund for up to one year, the profit is considered a short-term capital gain. You need to pay a 15% short-term capital gains tax on the income. Moreover, the amount does not depend on your income tax bracket. When you hold your investment in an equity mutual fund for over a year, you make long-term capital gains from it. If the profit is over ₹1 lakh, you need to pay a 10% long-term capital gains tax on the exceeding amount. Why are mutual funds good for you? If you are a beginner, mutual funds can serve as a starting point for your investments. As experienced fund managers handle these funds, you do not have to worry about keeping up with the market trends. Instead, the fund managers do it on your behalf and try to offer the best returns. There are a variety of mutual funds with different risk proportions. If you are not sure which one is right for your portfolio, consider using the “100 minus age” formula. For example, if you are 30 years old, your investment in risky equity mutual funds should be 70% (100-30). You must put the remaining amount in debt-based funds. Similarly, if your age is 50 years, your investment in equity-based funds should not be more than 50% (100-50). In simple words, you need to lower your risk appetite as you grow older. How to keep track of your mutual fund performance Tracking your mutual fund’s performance is easy if you know its NAV. When the NAV changes, the fund’s performance changes with it. If you have 100 units with a NAV of ₹10, the total fund value is ₹1000. If the NAV becomes ₹20, the total fund value will be ₹2000, reflecting a profit of ₹1000. Before investing in a mutual fund, it is important to choose the right one as per your investment goals. You may determine which mutual funds are best suited for you based on your expected returns, budget, investment tenure, and risk appetite.

They are professionally managed instruments and are an excellent alternative for investors who want to  invest but do not understand the stock markets. Mutual funds also have a high potential to give high returns, helping investors build long-term wealth. This could be why Mutual Funds have gained immense popularity in the last few years. Read to find out how mutual funds have evolved in the last sixty years. Mutual funds and the economy Although the Mutual Fund industry was born way back in 1963, it only gained importance post-1991 economic reforms. Why's that? The private sector and foreign companies were allowed to introduce new Mutual Funds to India. This led to a surge in the number of Mutual Fund Houses or Asset Management Companies, investors, and total assets under management (AUM). The AUM increased from Rs 470 billion in 1993 to ₹ 39,46,257 crore  in 2023, a 25% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) in 30 years. This shows how quickly Mutual Funds gained popularity in the Indian markets So how do mutual funds contribute to the Indian economy? Mutual Funds act as financial intermediaries. This means they facilitate money transfers from investors to companies. When you invest in a Mutual Fund, the fund manager buys shares of a company. This increases the capital for that company, which in turn will be used for expanding the business, research, or maintaining the current growth. All this will make the company successful, which is healthy for the economy as it leads to higher gross domestic product (GDP). Now imagine what would be the contribution of thousands of companies pooling money from mutual funds! Mutual funds in India vs other countries A Dutch Merchant created the first mutual fund ever in 1774 in Europe. He pooled money from investors and created a diversified fund of bonds. After that, mutual funds spread like wildfire from Europe to the UK and the US. Two and half centuries later, mutual funds are still one of the most popular investment options across the globe. Despite being late in the game (early 1960s), India's mutual fund industry is growing rapidly. But still, India’s mutual fund market is underpenetrated. India’s AUM to GDP ratio is only 16%, whereas the global average is around 75%. This shows there is a lot of scope for growth in this industry. As the masses slowly accept mutual funds, India's AUM to GDP ratio is also expected to improve over the years. Below are the rankings of countries whose AUM to GDP percentage is the highest in the world in 2020. Country AUM to GDP (%) Rank in the World Luxembourg 8330.59% 1 Singapore 998.32% 2 Ireland 957.79% 3 Hong Kong 575.72% 4 Australia 185.10% 5 USA 140.16% 6 Netherlands 126.62% 7 Sweden 104.54% 8 Switzerland 99.61% 9 Canada 97.56% 10 India 15.84% 36 Source: TheGlobalEconomy.com History of Mutual funds in India Since its inception in 1963, the Indian Mutual Fund industry has undergone several changes. Broadly,  sixty years (1963-2023) of the Mutual Fund industry can be divided into five phases, with each phase encouraging saving and investing. The first phase lasted for about 23 years and was entirely under the control of UTI, a government entity. In 1987, public sector banks first issued Mutual Funds, marking the beginning of the second phase. In six years (1987-1993), the AUM has grown by a CAGR of 38.4%, indicating an increase in acceptance and trust on the part of investors. The third phase, which lasted for ten years (1993-2003), is one of the important phases for the growth of mutual funds in India. The government allowed private sector companies to issue Mutual Funds. As a result, the number of Mutual Funds and the AUM went up dramatically. In the fourth phase (2003-2014), a global financial crisis hampered the Mutual Fund industry's growth which shook investor confidence. To re-establish investor confidence, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced a slew of measures in the fifth phase (Since 2014). SEBI's efforts paid off, and the Indian Mutual Fund industry witnessed steady inflows. As of January 31, 2023, the industry AUM stood at Rs 39.62 trillion with over 142 million folios and 62 million active SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) accounts. Although SEBI's regulatory measures helped this growth, the distributors, agents, and technology provided last-mile connectivity and expanded the retail investor base. Astounding facts about the mutual fund in India Indian Mutual Funds industry has undergone dramatic changes in the last sixty years to become one of the most talked about sectors in the world. Following are some of the most noteworthy facts about the Indian mutual funds' industry. India is now the world's second-largest mutual fund industry, with over $400 billion in assets under management. The Mutual Fund industry in India is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world, with a CAGR growth of 17.5% over the past five years. More than 46 million households have invested in Mutual Funds in India. Although there are more than 40 Fund houses, the top 10 Fund houses or AMCs (Asset Management Companies) manage over 70% of the mutual fund assets in India. Biggest mutual fund scams in India Despite being one of the budding Mutual Fund markets in the world, the Indian Mutual Fund industry has witnessed several major scams. Following are some of the biggest scams in the Mutual Fund industry. UTI Scam The government set up the Unit Trust India (UTI) in 1963 to float and manage Mutual Funds. It had a monopoly for over 24 years until the government of India allowed public and private sector banks to launch their Mutual Fund schemes. Within 24 years of its monopoly, UTI built a huge investor base and handled assets worth Rs 67 billion (until 1988). UTI offered assured return schemes (ARS) to Mutual Fund investors, where it guaranteed fixed returns. However, it failed to set up an adequate guarantee. In other words, it didn't have enough capital to pay the assured returns to investors in case they withdrew their funds. Moreover, it sets the unit price arbitrarily at a price which was more than  the value of actual assets. The scam came into the limelight in 2001 when the markets plummeted due to the Ketan Parekh scam and other factors. The scam shook investor confidence, and they wanted to redeem their investments from UTI assured return scheme. However, lack of capital put a strain on UTI, and it banned all redemptions for six months which affected retail investors in a big way. To add to this, the institutional investors on the UTI board withdrew their investments before the crisis came into the limelight. All this affected retail investors which led SEBI to tighten the rules of mutual funds. Franklin Templeton Scam Franklin Templeton is one of the oldest Mutual Fund companies in India. In April 2020, the lockdown led to a lack of liquidity in the markets. With people staying at home and all business operations coming to a sudden halt, the money supply was reduced. Due to this illiquidity the fund house announced the closure of six debt mutual fund schemes. The total assets of these six schemes were almost Rs 300 billion. The withdrawal of the six debt schemes affected over three lakh investors. Despite investing in low-risk debt schemes, investors lost their money. Axis Mutual Fund’s Front-running Fraudulent Scheme One of the most recent scams in the Mutual Fund industry is the Axis Mutual Fund scam. Axis Mutual Fund, the seventh largest Fund house in the country, sacked two of its executives in May 2022 who might have engaged in front running. Front running is an act of trading stocks after being acquainted with some transaction information that will move the prices. This is considered illegal in India, and SEBI is investigating to dig deep into this. Mutual fund success stories Although several scams affected Mutual Fund investors, there are quite a few success stories as well. Many investors make a fortune by investing in Mutual Funds. Below are some of the oldest Mutual Funds in India that are performing well even today. Investors who invested in these Funds would’ve accumulated a lot of wealth by now. Franklin India Bluechip Fund – This Fund is 30 years old and has given an average return of 19.34% since inception. Had you invested Rs 1 lakh during its inception, you would've made Rs 2.01 crores by now. Franklin India Prima Fund – This 30-year-old midcap Fund has given an average return of 18.88% per annum since inception. Investing Rs 1 lakh in 1993 would have been Rs 1.79 crores now. HDFC Flexi cap – This 28-year-old fund has given almost 18.04% return since its inception. This means that every year, the value of the fund grew by an average of 18%. So had you invested Rs 1 lakh in 1995 in this fund, it would be Rs 1.03 crores today. HDFC TaxSaver – This Fund was introduced in 1996 and has given an average return of 23.27% since its inception. Had you invested Rs 1 lakh in this fund 27 years ago, you would be sitting at a profit of Rs 2.82 crores (current value Rs 2.83 crores). Are Mutual Funds better than gold and real estate? Even today, real estate and gold are the most preferred investments by many, especially baby boomers and generation X. When these generations started investing, there weren’t a lot of investment options available other than real estate and gold. Moreover, gold and real estate were considered wealth creators that lasted for generations. This could be why these two were the go-to investments. The current generation has no dearth of choices, and multiple investment options are available such as shares, Mutual Funds, currency, and private equity. Among these, the most popular one is Mutual Funds. Mutual Funds pool money from diverse investors and invest in equity and debt securities. The reason behind its popularity is that they fit into the middle-class budget. The minimum investment for Mutual Funds is just Rs 500, and setting aside such a small amount every month bodes well for the middle class. This isn't possible with gold and real estate. With gold prices climbing daily, investing in gold or buying gold jewellery is becoming a far-fetched dream. The same is the case with real estate. Buying a piece of land or investing in a house requires a huge sum of money. Although a home loan is an option, with rising interest rates, it could take years to repay the loan dues. Mutual Funds are superior to gold and real estate, even in terms of returns. Since Mutual Funds invest in marketable securities, the chances of making huge wealth in a few years are possible. However, this is not the case with gold and real estate, as these asset classes don't offer steep returns. In terms of liquidity, gold ranks ahead of Mutual Funds and real estate. However, Mutual Funds are quite liquid, and real estate has very low liquidity. With respect to risk, Mutual Funds are considered very risky as they invest in marketable securities. However, the risk is compensated with high returns. Gold and real estate are considered less risky than Mutual Funds as their value has only gone up with hardly any depreciation. Since each asset class has pros and cons, it is better to balance out a portfolio by spreading the investments across multiple asset classes. One can invest in both Mutual Funds and gold; however, the allocation depends on the risk tolerance levels of the investor. However, experts recommend investing a maximum of 10% in gold. This is because gold acts as an excellent hedge against market volatility. When it comes to real estate, it totally depends on the resources the investor has – a real estate is definitely an investment option if one has enough money to invest in it. Why should the young generation invest in Mutual Funds? The present young generation has endless opportunities to grow their money and wealth. This was never the case with previous generations, as all they had was a single-income job. However, the present generation has several income sources, and side hustling has become a routine. While working hard is one way to make more money, investing is a smart way to build long-term wealth. Investing helps build a financially secure future by making your money work for you. Investing from a young age will allow one to accumulate more money and reach all financial goals sooner than expected. Although there are several investment options available, Mutual Funds are quite popular. Several reasons contribute to this popularity, such as low minimum investment and monthly SIP breaking big financial goals into easily achievable instalments. Apart from this, the huge potential to give high returns long-term has made them an attractive choice for investors. Equity Mutual Funds have outperformed Fixed Deposits (FDs) in the last decade by 11% - 18%. They are expected to give a similar return in the future as well. With such high returns, it’s no wonder that Mutual Funds have instilled confidence in the mind of investors, especially the middle class who prefer FDs. The current young generation has the one thing Mutual Funds need - time. Mutual Funds have always performed well in the long term. With an abundance of time, the current generation can accumulate a lot of wealth for themselves. Let's see how. By starting early in life, the financial burden of saving is reduced. If you start investing Rs 1,000 per month from the age of 21 for 39 years at a below-average rate of 10% per annum, you can accumulate Rs 22.79 lakhs by the time you are 60. Imagine the corpus you can build by investing Rs 5,000 or Rs 10,000 a month at a higher rate! So, if you are not investing at a young age, you are definitely missing out on time. However, assessing your recourses, goals, and risk tolerance levels is best before investing. Happy investing!

He who understands it, earns it, he who doesn't, pays it.’ So, the compounding effect on a regular investment of a small amount over the long term can help you to accumulate a large corpus. Often, many individuals ignore the compounding effect on their investments, which can be one of the most important accelerators in growing their wealth and accumulating a huge corpus. And knowing how it works can help you to not only earn higher returns but also plan your life goals. What is the power of compounding? The power of compounding can be compared to the snowball effect where you can see a small ball of snow growing larger as it rolls down the slope. In the same way, compounding helps in increasing your savings by accumulating more returns on the interest earned on the initial principal investment. Compounding essentially earns ‘interest on interest’, which means you will not only earn the interest on your initial investment but also earn additional interest on these earnings. Eventually, compounding interest helps in building wealth over the years. How does the power of compounding work in investments? The most exciting effect of compound interest is that your investments accrue returns both on the principal amount as well as the previously earned interest. This means, compounding provides a broader base, which is added to the previous earnings at every investment cycle. Therefore, it is important you reinvest your earnings to build wealth. You must ensure you do not withdraw your earnings before the end of the investment period. It is recommended you choose the product and the horizon based on your financial goals and investible surplus. Here is an example to understand the power of compound interest. Let us assume you have invested INR 5 lakhs for a period of five years at an annual interest rate of 10%. Year Opening balance (INR) Interest (10% per annum) Closing balance (INR) 1 5,00,000 50,000 5,50,000 2 5,50,000 55,000 6,05,000 3 6,05,000 60,500 6,65,500 4 6,65,500 66,550 7,32,050 5 7,32,050 73,205 8,05,255 Thus, the value of your initial INR 5 lakhs at the end of five years is over INR 8 lakhs and the difference is the total capital gains earned as interest. How to gain the maximum compounding benefits? Here are three ways to maximize your gains from compound interest. Begin early When you start your investments early, you can stay invested for a longer period. The longer you stay invested, the more time will your money have to multiply, thereby helping in accumulating a significant corpus over the years. Additionally, the longer your investment horizon, the lesser will be the amount you need to save to build a huge fund. Make wise investment decisions Multiple financial instruments are available. It is recommended you conduct extensive research on the different products and invest in high-return products while considering your risk appetite. Your investment decisions should help deliver an attractive real rate of return to ensure you meet your financial goals and create wealth over the years. Grow your investments and be disciplined Most people know that they can build more wealth when they invest a higher amount; however, this is a commonly overlooked aspect. You should ensure you save more as and when your income increases. Additionally, invest regularly and follow discipline to create wealth. Opt for systematic investment plans (SIPs) that ensure a particular amount is invested in your chosen product at periodic intervals. How to calculate compounding benefits of any investments There are several investment options that offer compound interest on the principal amount. Generally, these financial products have a predetermined compounding period, such as annually, quarterly, monthly, and in some cases even daily. The formula to calculate compound interest is A = P x (1 + r/n) ^ (n x t) Where: A is the maturity amount, P is the principal amount, R is the interest rate per annum, N is the number of times interest is compounded, T is the investment period. Here is an example to understand what the power of compounding is. Assume that you invest INR 1 lakh at an annual interest rate of 10% for five years and the interest is compounded quarterly. Using the above formula, the maturity amount is as follows: A = 1,00,000 x (1+0.10/12) ^ (12 x 5) = INR 164530 Now, if you had invested INR 1 lakh in an instrument that offered 10% simple interest for five years, the accumulated amount at the end of the investment period would be only INR 1.50 lakhs. Therefore, compound interest investments help you build more wealth over the long term. Further, manual calculations may be tedious; so, you may use online calculators to estimate the power of compounding in a jiffy. Power of compounding in mutual funds As discussed, compounding can help in wealth creation when you invest a certain amount at regular intervals. But you may be wondering where to invest this money. The answer is in mutual funds via SIPs. You may invest a fixed amount at a certain interval, such as monthly, quarterly, bi-annually, or annually in your chosen mutual funds with compound interest option. Based on your financial goals, risk appetite, and investment horizon, you may consider investing in equity schemes to meet retirement needs as such funds can potentially deliver higher returns over the long term. Your SIP investments can grow exponentially over the years. You may use an online mutual fund compound interest calculator to determine how much your money can grow over your desired investment horizon. If you invest INR 10,000 per month for a period of 30 years at an expected return on investment of 15% per year, the total investment will be INR 36 lakhs. The total estimated returns will be approximately INR 6.65 crores, which shows the potential effect of mutual fund compounding. How to increase your savings by using the power of compounding? To increase your savings, it is advisable to opt for shorter compounding intervals. A shorter interval increases the impact of compounding, thereby allowing you to build a sizeable corpus. Direct equities or equity mutual funds can deliver higher returns but these products are subject to market volatility. If you are a risk-averse investor, consider putting money in fixed-income securities like debt funds, National Pension System (NPS), fixed deposits, and others. Basic rules of investing everyone should be aware of One of the basic rules of investing is to increase the investment amount to earn higher returns. If you have a limited income, you should look for ways to increase the investible surplus by reducing your expenses. Determine a budget and identify ways in which you can reduce the expenditure. Another rule is to be patient and not look for quick ways to make high returns. Chasing quick returns can lead to expensive mistakes. Compounding works best when you stay invested for the long term and let your money work for you to build a sizeable corpus over the years. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the power of compounding? With compounding, your returns on the initial investment are reinvested to earn additional income. As a result, you can build wealth over the years. How can you maximize the benefits of compounding? To maximize the benefits of compounding, it is recommended to start early, adopt a disciplined approach to saving and investing, and be patient to give your investments sufficient time to build a large corpus. Is daily or monthly compounding more beneficial? Monthly compounding means that the interest is calculated and reinvested every month whereas in daily compounding, it is calculated and reinvested every day. The basic principle of compounding suggests that the shorter the frequency of compounding, the higher will be the returns. Therefore, daily compounding is more beneficial than monthly compounding.

However, the newly added Section 194P of the Income Tax Act, 1961 requires banks to deduct taxes on senior citizens aged over 75 years earning pension and interest incomes from the institutions. The Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS) is aimed at the senior citizens of the country. It provides a regular source of income with tax savings and secured returns. SCSS is an excellent option for those aged 60 years and above. What is the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme? SCSS is a preferred fixed-income product for people aged 60 years and above. It was launched in 2004 and aims to provide senior citizens in the country with a regular source of income for their financial independence. SCSS provides assured interest income that is payable quarterly. Senior citizens can invest a lump sum either individually or jointly and receive an assured interest while availing of tax benefits. SCSS is backed by the government, and you can open an account with certified banks and post offices. How does the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme work? Now that the question, “what is the senior citizens savings scheme?” is answered, let us understand how it works. You need to open an account with a minimum of INR 1000 and a maximum of up to INR 15 lakhs in a single lump-sum payment. The deposit amount cannot exceed your retirement benefits, and it has to be deposited within one month of receiving these from your employer. Retirement benefits include any amount received, such as provident fund (PF), leave encashment, superannuation or retirement gratuity commuted value of pension, ex-gratia payments under voluntary or special voluntary retirement scheme (VRS), retirement-cum-withdrawal benefits under Employees’ Family Pension Scheme, or savings under a group savings-linked insurance scheme payable by your employer at the time of retirement. If the deposit exceeds retirement benefits, the excess amount is immediately refunded. Interest on the SCSS account is paid quarterly, which can be withdrawn through Electronic Clearing Service (ECS) or direct credit into the savings account. You can close the SCSS account at any time. After the maturity date, you may extend the account for an additional period of three years; the extension should be done within one year from the date of maturity. How to open a Senior Citizens Savings Scheme account? You can open an account with an authorized bank or post office. Here is how it can be done. Fill the account opening form Submit the form with know-your-customer (KYC) documents like identity, address, and age proof Attach two passport-sized photographs Provide a check for the deposit amount Add nominees to your account Eligibility criteria for SCSS You should be an Indian citizen; a Non-Resident Indian (NRI), Person of Indian Origin (PIO), and Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) are not eligible for the SCSS. All Indian residents aged 60 years and over are eligible with the following conditions: Retired individuals aged between 55 and 60 years who have opted for voluntary retirement or superannuation must apply for the scheme within one month of receiving their retirement benefits. If all other conditions are fulfilled, retired defense personnel can avail of the senior citizens’ scheme. Benefits of investing in SCSS Here are five benefits of investing in the Sr. Citizens Savings Scheme. Since the scheme is backed by the government, it provides assured returns and is a safe and reliable investment option for senior citizens. Interest is paid quarterly, giving senior citizens a regular source of income during their post-retirement years. Compared to other fixed-income investments like fixed deposits (FDs) and savings accounts, the SCSS interest rate is higher (presently 7.40%), thus delivering more returns. The process to open an SCSS account is simple, and you can open one with an authorized bank or post office. Investments of up to INR 1.50 lakhs in SCSS are exempt from tax under section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Limitations of SCSS SCSS is an excellent scheme for investors. However, it entails some limitations as listed below: The investment horizon is limited to five years with a one-time extension of three years, which means the maximum tenure is limited to eight years. Although the SCSS account can be closed prematurely, you will have to pay some penalty. Your actual returns on investment are reduced as the interest earnings are taxable; additionally, if the annual interest earnings exceed INR 50,000, tax deducted at source (TDS) is applicable. The maximum deposit is limited to the lower of INR 15 lakhs or the actual benefits received on retirement. What are the documents required to apply for SCSS? Permanent Account Number (PAN) card copy Address and identity proof, such as Aadhar card, job card issued by the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) signed by a state officer, passport, voter ID, or Regional Transport Office (RTO)-issued driving license.

Who Should Invest In It? By Jupiter Team · February 09, 2023 · 6 min read IN THIS ARTICLE Thematic funds, as the name suggests, are mutual funds that invest in equities in a specific investment theme. The themes are mostly based on certain trends and investment stories. For example, if you are optimistic about consumption, you can go for a thematic fund on investment which will invest in FMCG and other sectors related to rising consumption by people. A thematic fund diversifies across sectors to follow its theme. If you are a person who likes to track macroeconomic trends, you will have a taste for thematic funds. Thematic funds are predominantly equity-based. The key thing to remember is that it carries the risks that are inherent in equity-linked mutual funds. How Do Thematic Funds Work? Thematic funds create an investment thesis around a sector. This can be in Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) factors, which means investing in firms with performance on these parameters. It can be a thematic fund that is based on real estate. It can be a theme based on steel. The money that you put into this mutual fund will be invested in equities at the portfolio manager’s discretion. Money can be invested through the SIP or lumpsum model and can be withdrawn at any time. Who Should Invest in Thematic Funds? Professionals who have a very definite taste for investments in the high-risk equity segment can invest in thematic funds. An investor can go for an investment theme about which they are upbeat through these mutual funds. One of the reasons to invest in thematic funds is an investor gets to use the expertise of a reputed mutual fund rather than directly making investments in individual equity stocks, which can be comparatively riskier as an individual investor may not have the deep expertise or time to dedicatedly track the stocks. There are many benefits to investing through a mutual fund compared to putting all the available corpus directly in equity stocks. What are the Benefits of Investing in Thematic Funds? Thematic funds offer more diversification than sector-specific funds. This is because a thematic fund usually covers more than one sector. For example, a manufacturing-themed fund would invest in stocks across multiple sectors. So, if a sector is facing a downturn, the investment will shift to other industries. Possibility of high returns: Investing in an equity-linked fund brings with it the possibility of higher returns. If a theme proves to be right, and the fund manages its investments well, an investor stands a chance to make a high return on their investment. These are open-ended funds, so one can withdraw money as and when required. There is no lock-in period. What is the Risk Profile of Thematic Funds? Equity-related funds are always riskier than other types of funds. For instance, a well-performing fund may suddenly turn track, and stocks get beaten down very quickly. Thus, thematic funds come with these risks. The high volatility of equity-linked mutual funds makes them a high-risk, high-return investment play. What is the Right Investment Strategy for Getting Into Thematic Funds? Since this is a high-risk, high-return fund, an investor should set aside funds that he can afford to take a risk with. An investor should not invest funds meant for financial security and retirement in this kind of fund. An investor can look at it as a long-term equity investment and wait for returns to become substantial enough, and exit when the pricing is on the higher side. What are the Investment Options in Thematic Funds? There are plenty of thematic funds to choose from. You can pick a fund as per your examination of an investment story. For example, if you feel that manufacturing is going to pick up in a major way in the country, you can look at various manufacturing funds. The following are the most common categories of thematic funds: · ESG fund · Consumption fund · Energy fund · MNC fund · Manufacturing fund · PSU fund Fees and Charges of a Thematic Fund Thematic funds usually attract an expense ratio of 2-2.3%. This is much higher than other types of mutual funds. Many other diversified mutual funds charge an expense ratio of 1.4-1.8%. An investor should find out the expense ratio of the fund they are making an investment into, even though these are funds whose objective is to chase higher returns at the cost of higher expense and high risk. The cost is less if the mutual funds are bought through a direct fund plan. If an investor goes for a regular fund, a small commission is also paid to the advisor/intermediary. Taxation of Income in Thematic Funds Redeeming your funds in less than 12 months will involve paying short-term capital taxation. This means you pay 15% of the income as tax, plus surcharge and cess, irrespective of the tax slab to which you belong. If the funds are withdrawn after a year, the capital tax is reduced to 10%. There are some provisions in the income tax act which can be utilised, such as exemption of income of up to 1 lakh under long-term capital tax is waived in a financial year. This is can motivate youngsters to try out this fund. How Can One Make an Investment in a Thematic Mutual Fund? This can be done at the click of a few buttons. There is no need to go to any physical space. Go to Jupiter Money, and all that you need to make an investment is available, just register and swipe. Key Takeaway Thematic mutual funds offer a chance to make investments in equities through calculated and diversified risk. Investors who are following macroeconomic and market trends can invest in these mutual funds depending on their outlook for a particular segment. They gain by getting the expertise of mutual fund companies that actively track the market and have experience in investing, and have proven their ability to generate returns. There are times when some investment stories are doing well, such as PSU, manufacturing, MNC, energy, and consumption, and that is the time when investors look at thematic funds. One must remember, though, any fund that is dedicated to equities is subject to volatility and risk. Most investors who go for thematic funds are those who can digest the volatility and wait for a long-term horizon to get returns. Frequently Asked Questions Is a thematic fund a low-risk investment option? Not at all. For low-risk investments, one opts for mutual funds that are into debt instruments. Thematic funds invest money only in equities, and these are inherently a risky asset class. What is the lock-in period for investments in thematic funds? There is no lock-in period for investments in thematic funds. An investor can withdraw their funds on any business day. How long should one invest in thematic funds? Mutual funds dedicated to equities are based on long-term stories. In the long run, Indian companies grow, however, in the short run, they may face volatility and economic downturns. Thus, the mature investor in thematic funds gets into it for 5-7 years while keeping an eye on the investment regularly. How about the tax benefits of investing in a high-risk asset category? There are no taxation waivers in this category of investment. If you withdraw your money in less than a year, you are charged capital tax gains of 15%, and if you withdraw your funds are a year, this tax becomes 10%.

Many people struggle to determine where to put their money as all plans come with different rules and regulations. Presently, two popular financial instruments are unit-linked insurance plans (ULIPs) and mutual funds. This article explains the differences between both these options to help you make an informed decision. What is ULIP? A common question asked by many potential investors is, “what is ULIP?” Well, it is a combination of a life insurance policy and other investment options. When you opt for it, the fund managers use a portion of your money to create your life insurance policy, and put the remaining amount in debt, equity, or a hybrid fund as per your investment goal and risk appetite. A Unit-linked insurance plan (ULIP) is a suitable option for long-term financial planning as it allows your money to grow over a period. What is a mutual fund? A mutual fund is a financial product that pools money from different investors with similar goals and puts the capital in various assets such as bonds and securities. Experienced and professional fund managers are responsible for investing the money on your behalf so that you get the best possible returns. The three main types of mutual funds are as follows: 1. Equity funds In this type of mutual fund, the fund managers put at least 65% of your money in equities. These funds can potentially offer higher returns, but their performance depends on the financial market. The different types of equity-based mutual funds are as follows: Small-cap funds Mid-cap funds Large-cap funds Multi-cap funds Equity-linked savings scheme (ELSS) Thematic funds Index funds 2. Debt funds When you opt for debt-based mutual funds, at least 65% of your money is invested in safe, fixed-income products like certificates of deposit, government bonds, treasury bills, and others. Below is a list of different types of debt funds: Dynamic bonds Income funds Short-term debt funds Ultra-short-term debt funds Liquid funds Gilt funds Credit opportunities funds Fixed maturity plans 3. Balanced mutual funds This type of mutual funds balance risk and return by investing your money in both equity- and debt-based options. The fund managers can reallocate your funds between the debt and equity instruments depending on the financial market conditions. The different types of balanced mutual funds are as follows: Equity-oriented funds Debt-oriented funds Monthly income plans Arbitrage funds You can invest in mutual funds in two ways, a systematic Investment Plan (SIP) and one-time payment. SIP : This option allows you to invest small amounts in mutual funds over time. You may choose from different payment frequency options—bi-annually, quarterly, and monthly—as per your comfort. One-time payment : If you have a lump sum to invest, this is the ideal option for you. In this scenario, you invest some amount in a mutual fund through one transaction and wait for your money to grow over time. ULIPs vs. Mutual Funds - Where Should I Invest? Deciding whether to invest in a ULIP or mutual fund will be easier if you compare both options based on returns and additional benefits. Read on to get a better idea. 1.  How ULIPs and mutual funds work? When it comes to ULIPs vs. mutual funds with death cover, the benefit can differ based on your policy. For instance, if you wish to invest ₹25,000 a month to create a substantial life cover, the death benefit from both options will be as follows: ULIPs : You can expect a death benefit of ₹30 lakhs in four years, and ₹41 lakhs in 10 years. Mutual funds with life insurance : The death benefit will be ₹38 lakhs in four years, and ₹68 lakhs in 10 years. 2.  Benefits and reasons to invest in ULIPs Some noteworthy ULIP benefits that make them a great investment option are as follows : Life cover : ULIPs offer death benefits along with investment options. It ensures your loved ones remain financially secure in your absence. Switching option : The fund-switching option lets you reallocate your money between equity and debt funds depending on your changing investment goals and the financial market condition. Insurers allow you a fixed number of free switches. Tax benefits : Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 makes your investments tax-exempted up to ₹1.5 lakhs a year. Moreover, if your yearly premium is up to ₹2.5 lakhs, the maturity proceeds will be tax-free under Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. However, if your annual premium is over ₹2.5 lakhs, the proceeds will not be tax exempt. Additionally, you do not have to pay any tax for fund withdrawal and switching. 3.  Benefits and reasons to invest in mutual funds Mutual funds offer the following benefits, which make them an attractive investment option. Fund managers : Experienced fund managers handle your investments to meet your goals while managing risk. No lock-in period : Most mutual funds do not have any lock-in period. So, you can withdraw money from the fund as per your needs while adhering to the policy regulations. Flexibility : Mutual funds are more flexible compared to other investment options. They offer benefits like fund switching, SIP, diverse investment avenues, and much more. Tax benefits : ELSS is a type of mutual fund that offers tax benefits of up to ₹1.5 lakhs a year under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Although it has a three-year lock-in period, it is shorter compared to other tax-saving investment options. Things to consider before investing in ULIPs There are a few things that you must take into consideration before investing in ULIPs. These include the following. Personal goals : ULIPs are suitable for wealth creation in the long run. So, you must determine your future financial goals before investing. If you want to build a retirement fund or accumulate money for any other significant purpose, long-term investment in these plans may be beneficial. Lock-in period : They have a five-year lock-in period. Moreover, if you surrender the policy for any reason within the first three years of investment, you may lose the life cover. Charges : ULIPs entail multiple associated fees such as a 1.35% fund management charge, premium allocation cost, administrative charge, and much more. The insurance company deducts these costs from the premium. Furthermore, you have to pay an underwriting fee and commission. All these ULIP charges need to be paid when purchasing the policy and may affect your overall return. Tips to choose the best ULIPs To choose the best ULIPs for investment, you must keep the following tips in mind. Determine how much life insurance cover you need. Choose a plan according to your financial goals. Find out about the fees your insurer charges. Learn about the features of different ULIPs before buying one. Know about all the tax benefits. Consider investing in mutual funds and term insurance instead of ULIP (with an example) As mentioned earlier, ULIPs offer a death benefit of ₹30 lakhs in four years and ₹41 lakhs in 10 years for a monthly investment of ₹25,000. But, if you invest the same amount in a mutual fund and ₹1,000 per month in a term policy separately, you will get a higher life cover. For the monthly investment of ₹26,000, you will get a life cover of over ₹1 crore in four years and 1.43 crores in 10 years. For low-cost and flexible investment, opt for a term insurance cover that is 15 times your yearly income and put the remaining amount in mutual funds. FAQs 1.  What is the sum assured in ULIP? The sum assured is the minimum amount an insurer guarantees to pay the nominee in the case of the policyholder’s untimely demise during the policy tenure. 2. What is fund value in ULIP? A fund is made of units that have a Net Asset Value (NAV, which can change every day. The total monetary value of the units owned by you is known as the fund value. To determine this, multiply the NAV of each unit on a particular day by the total number of units you have. 3.  Is ULIP better than mutual funds? ULIPs allow you to build a fortune over time while providing a life insurance cover under one policy. However, if you invest in a mutual fund instead and buy a term life insurance policy separately, it will guarantee a significantly higher death benefit. 4. Which is better investment ULIPs or mutual fund? Mutual funds offer better returns than ULIPs 5. Why you should invest in ULIP now? Unit-Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP) will have the benefit of both life insurance and investment returns. You should analyse your personal financial goals, lock-in period and charges before investing in a ULIP because the returns might be lesser compared to Mutual funds.

By Jupiter Team · February 16, 2023 · 6 min read IN THIS ARTICLE When listed companies earn profits, some of them decide to retain the profits and reinvest in the business, while others decide to distribute them to their shareholders. The profits are distributed by the companies to the shareholders in the form of dividends. In simple words, dividends are the profits distributed to the shareholders of the company. Let’s understand them in detail and what happens to the unclaimed dividends of the shareholders. How Do Dividends Work? In India, the company's distribution of dividends is regulated by the Companies Act, 2013. Once the company earns profits, it may decide to distribute dividends to the shareholders. The dividends are usually denoted as a percentage of the face value of shares. For instance, if a company decides to distribute a 10% dividend and the face value of its shares is Rs. 100, then it will pay Rs. 10 per share as a dividend to the shareholders. However, in certain situations, the company pays the dividend, but the shareholders do not claim it. The dividend is to be paid by the company on demand and therefore is its liability. If the shareholder does not claim dividends within seven years, then such unclaimed dividends shall be transferred to the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF) account. However, the shareholder has the right to claim the unclaimed dividend at any point in time. Types of Dividend The following are the different types of dividends that a company may pay to its shareholders: Final dividend The final dividend is paid to the shareholders after the end of every financial year. It is proposed by the board of directors and approved by the shareholders in the general meeting. Final dividends are paid after the finalisation of the annual accounts of the company. Interim dividend The dividend paid between two general meetings of the company is called the interim dividend. It can be paid at any time between the two general meetings. However, companies usually prefer to pay interim dividends after declaring their quarterly results. The two types of dividends paid by the companies are described above. However, it is not necessary that the dividends always be paid in cash. The following are the ways in which the dividend is paid to the shareholders of the company: Cash dividend: Cash dividends are one of the most common types of dividends, and most companies prefer to pay their dividends by directly crediting the amount in the shareholder’s bank accounts. However, for large companies with numerous shareholders, it is important to have the required liquidity to pay dividends in cash. Stock dividends: These are usually given in the form of the issue of shares to the shareholders. Also known as the issue of bonus shares, here, the companies usually allot more shares to the shareholders at a predetermined ratio based on the existing shares. For instance, a bonus issue in the ratio of 1:2 implies that the company will issue 1 share for every 2 shares held by the shareholders. Property dividend: Companies can issue non-monetary dividends to the shareholders by distributing their assets. A property dividend or asset dividend is usually distributed when the company no longer requires an asset and wants to distribute it to the shareholders. In India, usually, dividends are distributed in cash or through the issue of bonus shares. Advantages and Disadvantages of Dividend There are advantages as well as disadvantages to dividend payments, both to the company and shareholders. If the company decides to retain the profits instead of distributing them as dividends, it can compound those profits. However, if the company decides to pay dividends to the shareholders, there will be an outflow of resources from its books. Dividends are paid from the company's reserves, which form part of equity. Distributing dividends leads to a reduction in the company's equity value as it directly reduces the reserves that the company is holding. For shareholders, dividend payments are a source of passive income. However, if the company retains the profits, it can lead to compounding and exponential growth in its share value. Impact of Dividends on Share Prices Once the company declares the dividend, it also declares a record date. All the shareholders holding shares on the record date are eligible to receive the dividend. Therefore, investors, in order to book extra income in the form of a dividend, start buying shares of such a company. The price of such shares starts to increase, and investors are even ready to pay a premium to buy them. However, once the record date expires, further investors won’t be eligible to receive the dividend. As a result, there is a fall in the share price because investors are no longer willing to pay a premium price for the shares. Dividend Payout Ratio vs. Dividend Yield Ratio Most often, people confuse the dividend payout ratio with the dividend yield ratio. However, there is a clear difference between the two. The dividend payout ratio indicates the portion of the company’s earnings being paid to the shareholders as dividends. The dividend yield ratio indicates the rate of return that shareholders earn on their investments. The following are the formulae for these terms: Dividend Payout Ratio = Annual Dividends Per Share / Earnings Per Share Dividend Yield Ratio = Annual Dividends Per Share / Price Per Share Let’s understand this with a practical example: If the earnings per share are Rs. 1000 and the annual dividend of the company is Rs. 100, then the dividend payout ratio is 10%. Further, suppose you have invested Rs. 2000 in a company’s shares, and you receive a dividend of Rs. 100 per share. Then the dividend yield ratio for you shall be 5%. Dividend vs. Buyback In both dividend and buyback, the shareholders receive the payment from the company. However, there is a difference between both. A dividend is when a company shares profits with its shareholders, while a buyback is when the company buys back its shares from the shareholders. Both these steps are taken by the company when it has excess liquidity and has earned good profits. Chronology of Dividend Issue From declaration to payment, issuing dividends is a four-step process. The following dates are prominent when it comes to the declaration and payment of dividends: Dividend declaration date: This is the date when companies declare their dividends. Dividend record date: Dividends are paid to the shareholders whose names appear in the list of shareholders on the record date. Ex-dividend date: Ex-divided date is when all the newly purchased and sold shares are not entitled to the dividend declared. Dividend payment date: This is the date when the dividend is paid to the shareholders. Best Dividend-Paying Stocks of 2023 As discussed earlier, not all companies pay dividends to shareholders. You can invest in dividend-paying stocks if you want to earn a good passive income. The following are some of the best dividend-paying stocks of 2022: Britannia Industries Punjab National Bank Balkrishna Industries Dr. Lal PathLabs Dalmia Bharat Polycab India Indian Hotels Company Happiest Minds Technologies In a Nutshell Dividend-paying stocks are a preferred investment avenue among investors. They provide a passive income, and their capital appreciation contributes to wealth creation. Further, investors can also go with dividend-paying mutual funds if they are new to investing or cannot put in adequate time in researching stocks. Dividend-paying mutual funds invest in high dividend-paying companies. If you are keen on investing in stocks, understand the category under which the stock falls and the implications of dividends beforehand. Note: this article is not a piece of investment advice. Professional consultation prior to making any significant investment decisions is highly advised. Frequently asked questions Do dividends attract income tax? Yes. Earlier, the dividend income was exempt in the hands of the shareholders because the companies used to pay the dividend distribution tax (DDT). However, in February 2020, DDT was abolished, and now investors are liable to pay tax on their dividend income. Within how many days shall the company pay dividend after its declaration? The company shall pay dividends within 30 days of the company's declaration. What is the tax rate applicable to dividend income? The dividends shall be taxed at the rate applicable to the taxpayers. Therefore, if you fall into the 20% tax bracket, you will pay tax at the same rate on your dividend income. What is the difference between unclaimed and unpaid dividends? The unclaimed dividend is the dividend paid by the company but not claimed by the shareholders. However, if the company does not pay a dividend after announcing it, then it is known as an unpaid dividend. Is unclaimed dividend an asset or a liability? Unclaimed dividend is a liability because companies are required to pay the dividend amount to shareholders whenever demanded.

Overview, Types, Formula, and Importance By Jupiter Team · January 11, 2022 · 7 min read IN THIS ARTICLE Wondering what is liquidity ratio? Simply put, it is a metric that helps understand a company’s ability to pay off short-term debt. It is helpful to estimate whether a company’s current assets can cover its liabilities. It is largely used by banks and other financial institutions to determine whether they can extend credit to a business. Importance of liquidity ratio A liquidity ratio can guide businesses on their ability to repay debt and help them plan better. In addition, it plays a significant role in other situations. It helps determine whether short-term obligations can be met Investors and creditors alike are likely to have a keen eye for the liquidity ratio of a business because it helps them ascertain whether an extension of credit is viable. A ratio of one is good but it isn’t always ideal. A higher ratio, perhaps of two or three, is what banks prefer to see because that means that a business can cover its liabilities sufficiently well. It helps estimate the creditworthiness of a company When lending to a company, creditors look at its liquidity ratio as a symbol of its creditworthiness. It is imperative that the company can back the debt it borrows, and the liquidity ratio is a good yardstick to learn that. It helps understand whether funds can be invested in a company A company with a good liquidity ratio of more than one is considered healthy and investment worthy. However, a high liquidity ratio, say 9%, is a problem because that means the company holds too much idle cash, which can be put to use elsewhere. At the end of the day, a company should be able to cover for liabilities and other bills, and at the same time, allocate its capital in a manner that can increase its value to its shareholders. It helps identify a company’s operational efficiency If you are to understand the inventory turnover of a company, this ratio can serve as a good benchmark. It helps to gauge how well a company sells off its inventory for cash and helps companies plan their production of goods, storage of inventory, and preparation for any overhead expenses. It helps optimize management The management of a company plays a significant role in its financial health. So, a financial metric like a liquidity ratio can help companies enhance management efficiency to keep up with creditors. Types of liquidity ratios As you already know, a liquidity ratio of more than one translates into good financial health. Let’s look at the different types of liquidity ratios. There is a liquidity ratio formula for each of these. Quick Ratio The quick ratio is also referred to as the acid-test ratio and is arguably the best way to measure the liquidity of a company. The explanation behind this lies in the formula used to calculate the quick ratio. Only short-term assets that can be easily converted into cash in less than 90 days or are already being held as cash are considered when calculating the quick ratio. A ratio of 1:1 (assets to liabilities) is generally held to be an ideal quick ratio. Quick Ratio Formula: Quick Ratio = Quick Assets/Current liability where, Quick Assets = Current Assets – Inventory – Prepaid Expenses or, Quick Ratio = (Marketable Securities + Available Cash and/or Equivalent of Cash + Accounts Receivable) / Current Liabilities Example Particulars Amount (Crores) Market securities 12,000 Cash and equivalent 68,000 Accounts receivable 7,500 Inventory 20,000 Current assets 1,07,500 Current liabilities 55,000 Quick ratio (12,000+68,000+7,500)/55,000 = 1.6 or (1,07,500-20,000)/55,000 = 1.6 Current Ratio The current ratio is also known as the working capital ratio. It measures your current assets like cash, receivables, prepaid expenditures, and others against your current liabilities like short-term loans, to determine whether the company can pay them off. Current Ratio Formula: Current ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities Example Current assets = 420 crores Current liabilities = 210 crores Current ratio = 420 crores/210 crores = 2 A ratio of 2:1 is considered healthy for a company. Cash Ratio The cash ratio tells you how well a company can pay off its current liabilities using cash and other equivalent instruments (treasury bills, marketable instruments, and others). Other assets that are not held as cash must not be included to calculate this ratio. Cash Ratio Formula: Cash ratio = Cash and cash equivalents/Current liabilities Example Cash and cash equivalent = 900 crore Current liabilities = 470 crore Cash ratio = 900 crore/470 crore = 1.91 Absolute Liquidity Ratio Creditors use this ratio to understand the total liquidity of the company. For the purposes of this ratio, only cash, and marketable securities of the company can be included. Absolute Liquidity Ratio Formula: Absolute liquidity ratio = (Cash + marketable securities)/ Current liabilities Example Cash = 600 crores Marketable securities = 1500 crores Current liabilities = 2000 crores Absolute liquidity ratio = 600 crores + 1500 crores/2000 crores = 1.05 Basic Defence Ratio Through this ratio, a lender can determine how far a company can handle its cash expenses with no financial help from outside. It is also known by the name defensive interval period. Basic Defence Ratio Formula: Basic defence ratio = Cash and equivalent + marketable securities + receivable/ daily operational expenses Daily operational expenses = (annual operational costs – noncash expenses)/365 Example Particulars Amount (in crores) Cash and equivalent 1,15,000 Marketable securities 45,000 Accounts receivable 70,000 Current liquid assets 2,30,000 Daily operational expenses Amount Annual operating costs 6,00,000 Non-cash expenses 80,000 Daily operational expenses 6,00,000-80,000/365 = 1,424 Basic defence ratio 2,30,000/1,424 = 161 Basic Liquidity Ratio Unlike the other liquidity ratio, the basic liquidity ratio does not pertain to a company. Instead, it is a personal finance ratio that determines the length of time that a family individual can take care of itself with its liquid assets. Basic Liquidity Ratio Formula: Basic liquidity ratio= Monetary assets/Monthly expenses Example Monetary assets = 500000 Monthly expenses = 250000 Basic liquidity ratio = 500000/250000 = 2 Apart from these, there is the liquidity coverage ratio that reflects the proportion of highly liquid assets that financial institutions like banks and others hold to ensure their capability to meet short-run obligations. Understanding a good liquidity ratio Understanding the different formulas and liquidity ratio examples can have several benefits. It will not only help you identify your company’s current financial health but also serve as a good measure of what is to be done to offset a deficit if any. As we discussed earlier, a good liquidity ratio is anything that goes north of one. However, in most cases, it is insufficient to prove the creditworthiness and the investment worthiness of your business. Several creditors and investors look for an accounting liquidity ratio that hovers around two or three. Naturally, a higher liquidity ratio spells a healthier margin of safety as far as your ability to pay off debts and other obligations is concerned. However, it isn’t always a good thing. For instance, if your liquidity ratio is too high then investors might wonder what you’re doing with excess cash. It questions the company’s intentions to grow and its focus on profits. Instead of holding too much cash in hand, it is more profitable to allocate your capital to other initiatives and investments. The complete picture may not be presented if you were to look at just the liquidity ratio separately. It needs to be combined with other financial metrics and compared with ratios over a period to understand the trend that your company has been following in terms of financial health. If your liquidity ratios are volatile, then your company may be looked at as operationally risky and financially unstable. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Are solvency and liquidity the same? If not, how are they different? No, they are not the same. Liquidity is a measure that assesses the company’s assets to cover its short-term debt. On the other hand, solvency is the ability of a company to pay off its total debt while continuing to be in business. To understand the solvency of a company, its liquidity needs to be considered. What is the ideal current ratio? An ideal current ratio is anything more than one. A higher current ratio is an indicator of a good financial position. However, please note that a high accounting liquidity ratio is not necessarily a good thing. What is meant by SLR? According to certain guidelines set by the RBI, a business (a commercial bank) must hold a minimum percentage of certain assets such as government securities, cash, gold, and others. This percentage is referred to as the Statutory Liquidity Ratio or SLR. What is the most liquid asset? The most liquid asset in the world is cash. If a business or a company holds a good reserve of cash, liquidity ratios are consequently higher. In other words, the business is in a good position to pay short-term financial debt with no support from the outside. However, a very high reserve of cash means that the business has poorly allocated capital and that might raise concerns in a few creditors.

How To Open A Demat Account? By Jupiter Team · April 26, 2023 · 10 min read IN THIS ARTICLE It is important to invest to secure your financial future. There are many investment alternatives for you to invest such as shares, mutual funds, and bonds. To invest in these securities, it is important to have a demat account. Read to find out more about a demat account, how to open it and the benefits of having a demat account. What is demat account? A demat account also known as dematerialised account is an important requirement in the stock market. It is an account in which you can save your shares and mutual fund purchases. Since a demat account can be accessed from anywhere, you don't have to carry physical shares or mutual fund certificates. Prior to 1996, people used to hold physical share certificates against their share purchases. However, in 1996, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced a demat account. Hence all physical shares were converted into digital form/ dematerialised form and stored in 'demat' accounts. Today, physical share certificates are no longer issued. A demat account is necessary to trade in shares and other securities. So, once you purchase the securities, they are reflected in your demat account and remain there until you decide to sell them. Why is a demat account needed? A demat account is necessary to trade in securities such as shares and mutual funds. However, it does more than just store your investments. Following are some of the reasons why a demat account is important. Since it stores securities in digital form, there is no risk of theft or damage. It eliminates unnecessary paperwork. Enables quick transfer of shares after a purchase and sale. Streamlines the process of trading and investing in securities. Types of Demat Account There are three different types of demat accounts available in India: regular demat accounts, repatriable demat accounts, and non-repatriable demat accounts. Regular demat account A regular demat account, simply known as a demat account, is for all residents of India. This is the most common type of demat account available to investors. It stores your purchase of securities in digital form. When you trade in securities using your trading account, they will get credited or debited from your demat account. However, if you are trading in futures and options (derivatives), you don't need a trading account, as these contracts don't need storage. SEBI has recently introduced a new type of demat account known as basic services demat account to encourage new investors to open a demat account. This account has no maintenance charges if the holding value is below Rs 50,000. If the holding value is between Rs 50,000 and Rs 2 lakhs, the maintenance charges are Rs 100. Repatriable demat account Non-resident Indians (NRIs) have the option to invest and trade in Indian securities by opening a repatriable demat account. It allows Indians staying abroad to invest, trade and transfer funds back from India. To have a repatriable demat account, you must have a non-resident ordinary (NRE) bank account. Once you become an NRI, you must close the regular demat account and transfer the shares to a specific demat account known as the NRE demat account. If you want to repatriate the funds back, a repatriation restriction comes into play. As per this restriction, the maximum funds you can transfer in a calendar year (January – December) is $ 1 million. Non-repatriable demat account Non-repatriable demat account is again for NRIs. However, you cannot repatriate the funds abroad once you sell the securities in this demat account. The demat account must be linked to a non-resident ordinary (NRO) account. Difference between Demat and Trading account When investing and trading in securities, you must have both demat and trading accounts. Although these accounts have different functions, they are codependent on each other and make trading possible. Let’s look at the differences between these two accounts. Functionality: Demat account helps in storing your investments in digital format. A trading account, on the other hand, helps you buy and sell securities. Nature: The demat account shows the securities you own, whereas the trading account shows the transactions you have done. Role: The roles of trading and demat accounts are different but interrelated. A trading account helps in purchasing and selling securities. In contrast, a demat account takes the delivery of shares. With a demat account, it is impossible to trade in shares and securities. Benefits of a Demat Account Following are the benefits of having a demat account. No physical certificates: With a demat account, there is no hassle of storing physical share certificates. Moreover, your investments will not be subject to physical damage as they are stored electronically. Easy trading: Since all your investments are stored in one place, tracking and trading them will be easy. Variety of instruments: Demat account doesn't just store shares. You can also store mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), index funds, and government securities. Hence with a demat account, you can store, track and monitor all your investments in one place. Easy access: The securities in your demat account can be accessed anywhere and anytime using your smartphone or laptop. It not only makes your investments accessible but also secure. Nomination facility: Demat accounts have a nomination facility. So in case the investor passes away, the nominee will automatically get all the investments, avoiding long procedures and legal disputes. How to open a demat account online? Demat accounts are managed by National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) and Central Depository Services Limited (CDSL), the two main depositories in India. However, you cannot open a demat account with them. Instead, you must go to a depository participant (DP) to open a demat account. Steps to open a demat account You can open a demat account through a depository participant (DP) either online or offline. Below is the step-by-step procedure to open a demat account online. Search for a depository participant: So many depository participants offer different services for demat accounts. Choose a depository participant based on the services they offer and the charges they levy for maintaining the account. You can choose depository participants here from this list on NSDL - https://nsdl.co.in/dpsch.php Some of the common names include Zerodha, UpStox, Groww Create an account: Once you select your DP, you must create an account with them by providing all necessary details such as name, date of birth, mobile number, email ID, and PAN card number. You must also provide your bank details so you can get the interest, dividend, and proceeds when you sell your shares. Upload documents: Support all the information you gave above by uploading necessary documents such as a photo, PAN card, Aadhar card, etc. Verification: Once you upload the documents, you must verify your identity. Since it is completely digitised, record a small video of yourself by reading the given script on the screen and uploading it. E-sign: You must digitally sign the documents using your Aadhar-linked mobile number. An OTP will be sent to your phone, and you must enter it to e-sign the application. This method is convenient, secure, and has zero paperwork involved. Submit: Once you e-sign, submit the application, and a demat account will be created shortly after that. You will receive the details of your demat on your email ID and phone. The email will also have your login credentials. Documents required for opening a demat account SEBI has mandated that any person who wants to open a demat account must have certain documents. Following are documents you will need to open a demat account. Passport size photo PAN Card Proof of identity – PAN Card, Aadhar Card, Passport, Voter ID Proof of address – Aadhar Card, utility bills, driving license, Bank statement and cancelled cheque IT return or pay slip if you want to trade in derivatives Types of fees and charges associated with opening a Demat Account To open and maintain a demat account, depository participants charge various fees. The fees vary across stock brokers. Hence it is important to choose the one with low fees. However, along with fees, you must also compare the benefits they offer and choose the one giving the maximum services at a low cost. Following are the charges demat account holders pay in general. Account opening fee: It is a one-time fee charged by stock brokers at the time of opening a demat account. Sometimes, the fee is waived to encourage new investors to open a demat account. Annual maintenance fee: It is a recurring fee charged by DPs to maintain your demat account. The maintenance fee varies based on the holding value and transactions you make yearly. Transaction fee: DPs charge you a transaction fee every time you purchase or sell securities. Some DPs charge you on a monthly basis, while some charge per transaction. Demat account safety charges: To ensure your securities are safe in demat form, DPs charge a safety charge. It is levied every month based on International Securities Identification Number (ISIN). Pledging fee: It is a fee charged for pledging securities in your demat account. Unpledging fee: It is a fee charged to unpledged your pledged securities. Dematerialisation fee: A dematerialisation fee is charged when you want to convert your physical shares into the dematerialised format. How to reduce demat charges? Demat charges mentioned above are quite normal for any active trader. However, if you aren’t an active trader, you can reduce your demat charges by opening a basic service demat account. This type of demat account has zero maintenance fee. However, the maximum holding limit for availing of the zero-maintenance fee benefit is Rs 2 lakhs. If you are an active trader, you can reduce your demat charges by opting for discount brokerage plans offered by DPs. Such plans offer a flat fee for brokerage services or have reduced transaction fees. Hence active traders can save a lot by opting for such plans. Link Bank account to Demat account To trade and invest in securities, it is important to link your demat account with your bank account. Most of the time, banks offer a three-in-one account which has demat, trading and bank account linked together. However, sometimes, many investors end up taking a demat and trading account from a depository participant due to low expenses and convenience. In such cases, linking your bank account with your demat and trading account is necessary. Below are some of the ways to link your bank account with your demat account. Through a payment gateway: You can add funds through a payment gateway offered by banks. You can use either a debit card or a net banking facility to do so. Some banks charge a nominal fee for using their payment gateway. Hence consider these charges before opting for this method. Through NEFT/RTGS: To add funds to your demat and trading account through NEFT or RTGS, you must add your demat account as a beneficiary in your net banking portal. After the beneficiary gets added, you can transfer funds whenever you need. Through UPI: UPI is the most convenient way to add money to your demat and trading account. All you have to do is select UPI while adding funds to your demat account. The funds are reflected almost immediately in your demat or trading account. How to invest in mutual funds without a demat account? No, you don’t require a demat account to invest in mutual funds. Below are some of the ways you can invest in mutual funds without a demat account. Through asset management company (AMC): You can invest in mutual funds directly through a fund house or asset management company. AMCs have their own websites, or you can also visit a branch personally. If you invest directly through this method, you can only invest in the funds of that AMC. Moreover, there won't be any periodic portfolio review, and you won't be able to track all your mutual funds in one place if you invest. Offline distributors: There are many offline distributors who help you invest in mutual funds. They suggest funds as per your goals and do all your paperwork. However, you won't be able to track your funds in real-time as you have to rely on these distributors. Hence it is better to invest online through mutual fund platforms. Online platforms: There are many online platforms that offer direct and regular mutual funds. They also suggest funds from different fund houses based on your goal and investment horizon. Moreover, these platforms do periodic portfolio reviews ensuring your portfolio is progressing towards your goal. Demat accounts for minors A demat account can be opened in the name of minors. However, the account will be operated by a guardian until the minor attains majority. The guardian can be a father, mother, or any person appointed by the court. Free demat account with no annual charges Many depository participants offer free demat accounts with no annual charges. Moreover, they also waive account opening charges to encourage aspiring investors. However, they do charge a brokerage fee which is fixed regardless of the trade value. Frequently Asked Questions 1. Do you need a demat account to invest in mutual funds? No, you don’t need a demat account to invest in mutual funds. You can invest through the fund house, offline distributors, or online mutual fund platforms. 2. Can you open two demat accounts?

The employees invest 12% of their basic pay in the EPF each month, and the employers contribute the same amount to the fund. This accumulated money in EPF earns annual interest and the employees can withdraw the fund at retirement. EPF withdrawal is also possible if an employee leaves the job and stays unemployed for at least two months. If you want to know how to withdraw money from EPF, this article can help you understand the process. Procedure for EPF withdrawal online Before you can withdraw money from EPF online, there are two things you must ensure: You have an activated Universal Account Number (UAN) The UAN is linked to the Know Your Customer (KYC) documents (Aadhaar card, bank details, and permanent account number (PAN) card) Once you confirm the above conditions, follow the ten steps given below to withdraw from the EPF fund. Visit the UAN Member Portal and login using the UAN and password Click the ‘Online Services’ tab on the menu bar Click on the ‘Claim (Form-31, 19 & 10C)’ on the drop-down menu Provide the last four digits of your bank account when you see the Member Details page, and click on the ‘Verify’ button Sign the undertaking certificate by clicking on ‘Yes’ and then proceed Select the ‘Proceed for Online Claim’ option Click on the ‘PF Advance (Form 31)’ option Select ‘Purpose for which advance is required’, and provide your address and the amount required on the form Check on your certification and submit the application Upload the scanned copies of the required documents depending on your purpose of application After completing the process of EPF claim online, wait for your employer’s approval. Once they sign off, the accumulated funds in your EPF will be transferred to your bank account. You will receive an SMS notification on the phone number registered with the Employees’ Provident Fund Organization (EPFO). Procedure for EPF withdrawal offline If you are not comfortable with online withdrawal, it is possible to do it conventionally. You can make the EPF claim for withdrawal by visiting a jurisdictional EPFO office near you. You must submit a duly filled Non-Aadhaar Composite Claim Form attested by your employer or the Aadhaar Composite Claim Form, which does not have to be attested by your employer. Advantages of EPF withdrawal online Here are some benefits of withdrawing money from your EPF account online. Easy withdrawal : Visiting an EPFO office can be tiring —you need to travel to the office and wait in queue for your turn. But you can complete the procedure online right from the comfort of your home, using your computer or phone. This makes the process hassle-free. Quick process : Once you apply for a withdrawal from EPF, it takes about 15 to 20 days to process the claim and transfer the money to your linked bank account. The Government of India even intends to reduce the time further. Therefore, it is in your best interest to make the withdrawal claim online. Eliminates the need for employer’s verification : Offline withdrawal of EPF may require you to ask your employer to attest the necessary documents. This can be especially difficult if you have moved to another city. That is where making an online claim can be helpful as it is automatically verified without requiring the employer’s attestation. What are the documents required for EPF withdrawal online? Making an EPF withdrawal online requires you to submit the following documents. Duly filled Composite Claim Form Identity proof Personal data like date of birth, father’s name, and other information that match with your ID proof Address proof One canceled and blank check with a clearly noticeable account number and Indian Financial System Code (IFSC) Bank account statement Two revenue stamps The above mentioned documents are sufficient only if you are making a withdrawal after a minimum of five years of employment with the same company. Any claim made before that requires you to provide ITR Form 2 and Form 3. The forms show a complete breakup of the amount deposited in your EPF account each year. Eligibility criteria for EPF withdrawal You can withdraw the entire EPF amount only after retirement. You need to be over 55 years of age to withdraw the fund in case of early retirement, as per rules stated by the EPFO. You can make partial withdrawals in case of financial needs such as house construction or purchase, higher education, or a medical emergency. You can withdraw 90% of the funds one year before your retirement. You can withdraw the amount in case of unemployment before retirement because of retrenchment or lock-down. You can withdraw 75% of the fund after one month of unemployment. You will get the rest in your new EPF account after you get another job.

The Employee Provident Fund (EPF), also known as Provident Fund (PF) , is a retirement benefit scheme that private sector companies offer to their employees. This scheme comes under the Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, to ensure the financial security of private-sector employees. The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) regulates the scheme. Under this structure, both employers and employees contribute an equal amount to the fund. Simply put, you invest a portion of your monthly salary in the PF, and your employer adds the same value to the fund. You receive the income generated from the PF after retirement. Thus, EPF assists in providing financial security even after retirement or loss of employment. Read on to learn how to calculate the proceedings from your PF account using our PF Calculator . What Is PF Calculator? Our calculator will help you determine the amount of money generated by your  EPF and how much you can expect to get at retirement. Our online EPF  calculator : Eliminates the need for calculating the PF amount manually every month. Eliminates the need of tracking changes in the PF interest rate as our calculator uses the current rate automatically. Informs you about any recent changes, contributions, or transactions after every use. Our notifications help you stay up-to-date with the PF account and any regulation introduced by the EPFO. It comes with the assurance that the information regarding your EPF remains accurate every time. How to Calculate EPF? Before understanding the formula used for our EPF calculator, you need to have an idea about a few details, such as the basic monthly salary and Dearness Allowance (DA) , your EPF contribution percentage, the employer’s contribution, and the interest rate. To explain the PF calculation formula, let us assume that your basic monthly salary with Dearness Allowance (DA) is ₹15,000, your contribution to EPF is 12% of the amount, and the employer’s contribution towards EPF is 3.67%. The employers invest the remaining 8.33% in the Employee Pension Scheme. As per the above illustration: Your contribution to the EPF will be 12% of ₹15,000 = ₹1,800 Your employer’s investment in EPS will be 8.33% of ₹ 15,000 = ₹1,250 Your employer’s contribution towards EPF will be your contribution minus the employer’s contribution towards the EPS = ₹1,800 - ₹1,250 = ₹550 Hence, the total monthly contribution to the PF account will be ₹1,800 + ₹550 = ₹2,350 With the current yearly interest rate of 8.5%, you will get a monthly interest rate of 8.50%/12 = 0.70% (approximately). The value of the PF fund on your joining month will be ₹2,350, as the employers do not pay any interest for the first month. The following month, the total contribution will become ₹2,350 + ₹2,350 = ₹4,700. You will also receive an interest of ₹4,700 x 0.7083% = ₹33.29. The PF calculation uses the same formula for the subsequent months. Benefits of EPF Scheme Some of the essential features and benefits of EPF include: You can avail of its multiple tax exemptions. The interest earned, any withdrawal made after the first five years of employment, and maturity returns from the EPF offer tax benefits. Additionally, Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 makes your contribution to the PF tax-deductible. However, the interest earned from the EPF is tax-free only if your yearly contribution is under ₹2.5 lakh. If it is over this amount, you will have to pay a tax on the interest income. You can make withdrawals from the PF in case of any financial or medical emergency before the scheme’s maturity. You can add a family member as your nominee to the PF. If an unfortunate event leads to your absence, the nominees will receive the accumulated PF amount. You also get a life insurance cover under the EPF, ensuring the financial security of your nominees. Employees Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme (EDLI)1976 rules offer this benefit. You can withdraw the money from your PF after two months from the date of resignation if you decide to leave the job. You also have the option to use the Volunteer Provident Fund feature of PF, which allows you to contribute more than 12% if you so wish. Changes in PF interest rates over the years EPFO’s Central Board of Trustees consults with the Ministry of Finance to determine the EPF interest rate every year. Here is a list of the interest rate over the last six financial years. FY Interest Rate 2016-17 8.65% 2017-18 8.55% 2018-19 8.65% 2019-20 8.50% 2020-21 8.50% 2021-22 8.10% 2022-23 8.15% 2023-24 8.25% How to check your EPF account balance online Understanding how PF is calculated is necessary to determine your profits from the scheme.  You can also find the balance online through multiple options, such as: 1. Umang App by the Government of India Follow the below steps to check the EPF balance with the Umang App. Download the app on your smartphone Register on the app with your mobile number Check the EPF balance along with raising and tracking claims 2.  SMS If your Universal Account Number (UAN) is registered with the EPFO, you can find the PF balance and your latest contribution by sending an SMS from your registered phone number. Type ‘EPFOHO’ followed by the UAN and the first three letters of your chosen language, for example, ENG for English. Send it to 7738299899. 3.  Missed call Give a missed call to 011-22901406 from your registered mobile number to know the PF balance. This option only works if the UAN is linked with your PAN, Aadhar Number, and bank account. If the accounts are not already linked, you can request your employer to do it. 4.  E-Sewa Portal The EPFO E-Sewa Portal lets you check your EPF passbook online. Register your account with the portal and link your UAN first. Then, to see or download the passbook online: Visit www.epfindia.gov.in and log in using your registered account. Find the ‘Our Services’ section and click the ‘For Employees’ option under it. Select the ‘Member Passbook’ alternative under the ‘Services’ section. Log in to the ‘Passbook’ section using your ID and password to check your EPF balance. How to transfer money from an existing EPF account Even if you change your job, your UAN will remain the same. You can use it to transfer the money to your new employer’s EPF account. Here are the steps to complete the process successfully: Log in to the EPF members’ portal. Enter the ‘Online Transfer Claim Portal section’ and log in using the same ID and password that you used for the EPF portal. Click the ‘Request for Transfer of Funds’ option and provide the required details about your previous employer. Get the information authenticated by either your new or previous employer. Save the PIN that you will get via SMS on your registered mobile number. Save the tracking ID that you will receive to use for checking the transfer application’s status. FAQs Can I use the same calculator after changing my employer? Yes. Input the relevant information required and use our calculator seamlessly, even after you switch jobs. How many times can I use the calculator? You can use our EPF Pension calculator as many times as you want. Calculate the interest earned over the years and the total sum after retirement.

You may often look for different options to determine the returns offered by various investment products. However, you may not know that these earnings are nominal returns and not the actual money you will receive in your pocket. Well, your return on investment is affected by inflation and taxes. Read on to know more. What Is Inflation? You may have heard this term frequently but do you know what is inflation rate ? In simple terms, inflation means the rising living cost over a period or the lower value of money. It is the general increase in the price of goods and services over the years, which decreases your purchasing power. For example, the price of a movie ticket five years ago was significantly lower than what it is today. So, if the inflation rate is 2% and the movie ticket costs INR 100 today, its price one year later will be INR 102. What Is Inflation Rate? The retail inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) reduced to 5.59% in July 2021 against one year ago when it was recorded as 6.69% in August 2020. The current inflation rate in India is between 2% and 6%, which is within the range of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Types of Inflation Inflation is a quantitative measure of changes in prices of goods and services over a period and is denoted as a percent. As inflation increases, the purchasing power decreases and vice versa. Here are the 3 types of inflation. Demand-pull inflation: It results when the demand for the goods and services exceeds their supply, and this difference results in a price increase. Cost-push inflation: It is the result of the increase in production costs due to rising input prices like those of labor and raw materials. Built-in inflation: It is the effect of future expectations; higher prices result in more wages, which offer better living standards, thereby continuing the cycle Inflation Effect on Investment The effects of inflation are not limited to lower purchasing power. It may result in the demand for higher wages to meet rising prices, which may mean more unemployment due to lay-offs. High inflation can also weaken the country’s currency and make domestic products less competitive in the global markets. What Is Nominal Rate of Return? When you invest in any asset class, the potential returns are always nominal as these are calculated before tax and inflation. The nominal rate of return is the profit on your investments before considering factors like inflation, investment fees, and taxes. Therefore, when you say that your investment returns are 10%, it actually means the nominal return is 10%. Comparing nominal returns of different asset classes helps you make the right investment decision as tax implications for every financial instrument may vary. Nominal Rate of Return Calculation The formula to calculate nominal return is as follows: (End Value – Begin Value) / Begin Value Let us understand this with an example, assume that you invested INR 10 lakh one year ago and its value today is INR 11 lakh, the nominal return is as follows: (1100000 – 1000000)/1000000 = 100000, which is 10% returns on your initial investment What Is After-Tax Real Rate of Return? The post-tax earnings are the returns after adjusting for the tax implications on the profits. Generally, the tax implications vary from one asset class to another and are also dependent on the investment horizon, age, and income tax slab. After-Tax Real Rate of Return Calculation The after-tax real rate of return is calculated as Nominal Rate of Return x (1 – Tax Rate) Let us take the above example, where the nominal rate of return was 10%. Now assume that the applicable tax rate is 20%. The after-tax returns will be 10% x (1 – 20%) = 8% What Is Tax Rate? It is the rate at which the tax liability is calculated on your income. Below are the tax rates for individuals as per the old and new tax regime: Tax slab Tax rate: old regime Tax rate: new regime Up to INR 2.50 lakhs Nil Nil INR 2.50 lakhs – INR 5 lakhs 5% of income exceeding INR 2.50 lakhs + 4% cess 5% of income exceeding INR 2.50 lakhs INR 5 lakhs – INR 7.50 lakhs 20% of income exceeding INR 5 lakhs + INR 12500 + 4% cess 10% of income exceeding INR 5 lakhs + INR 12500 INR 7.50 lakhs – INR 10 lakhs 15% of income exceeding INR 7.50 lakhs + INR 37500 INR 10 lakhs – INR 12.50 lakhs 30% of income exceeding INR 10 lakhs + INR 112500 + 4% cess 20% of income exceeding INR 10 lakhs + INR 75000 INR 12.50 lakhs – INR 15 lakhs 25% of income exceeding INR 12.50 lakhs + INR 125000 Exceeding INR 15 lakhs 30% of income exceeding INR 15 lakhs + INR 187500 What Is Cess? Do you know what is cess? A cess is a tax levied by the government on taxes for specific purposes until the authorities receive the required funds to meet their purpose. It is different from the regular tax levied on your income and is a tax on the tax. The regular tax collected by the department is retained in the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI) and can be used for any purpose as required. On the other hand, the revenues collected as cess are first credited to the CFI and after the appropriation from the Parliament, the government may use it for its deemed purpose. Another difference between regular tax and cess is that the former is shared with the state governments while the latter may or may not be shared with the state governments. The various types of cess on income tax that may be levied by the government include education, health, clean energy, Krishi Kalyan, and Swachh Bharat cesses. How to Calculate Post-Tax Returns? The post-tax returns on investments are calculated after considering the implication of cess on the actual tax. For example, if the cess is levied at 4%, then the post-tax return calculation is as follows: Nominal Return = INR 100000 Tax @ 20% = 100000 x 20% = INR 20000 Cess @ 4% = 20000 x 4% = INR 8000 Post-tax returns = 100000 – 20000 – 800 = INR 79200, which is 7.92% What Is Real Rate of Return? As discussed above, inflation erodes the value of money. Therefore, the value of INR 1 lakh today is not the same as it was one year ago. To know the actual profit, you earn on your investment, calculating the real returns is recommended. The real rate makes the necessary adjustments on the profits for the effects on inflation and is an accurate measure of your actual earnings. Nominal returns are generally higher than the real rate of returns except when inflation is zero or in the case of a deflating economy. Real Rate of Return Calculation Let us understand how to calculate the real returns with an example. Assume that you have saved INR 1,00,000 to pay for a new car, but you decide to invest it in a fixed deposit for one year that provides a 5% rate of interest. On maturity, you will receive INR 1,05,000 on the deposit. Now consider that the rate of inflation during the year is 3%, which means the car now costs INR 1,03,000. Therefore, after paying for the car, you will be left with INR 2000 on your initial investment of INR 1,00,000, giving you real returns at 2% against the nominal fixed deposit interest rate of 5%. The real rate of return formula is [(1 + after tax rate) / (1 + rate of inflation)] – 1 How to Calculate Absolute Return? Absolute return is the absolute profit or loss earned on your investments over a certain period. The profit or loss is generally shown as a percentage of the total investments. The formula for calculating absolute return: [(Current Value – Purchase Value) / (Purchase Value)] x 100 If you invest INR 20 lakhs in a property today and sell it for INR 25 lakhs after two years, the absolute return will be [(2500000 – 2000000) / 2000000] x 100 = 25% What Is Actual Profit? When you invest in different assets, you may study the historical returns, which are the nominal returns delivered by these products over a period. However, inflation and tax are real and affect your actual returns. The actual earnings are those that are adjusted for inflation and tax and are the amount that you will receive in your pocket.

This is because gold is considered as a symbol of wealth. Although gold is bought mainly for the purpose of consumption in the form of jewellery, it is an excellent investment alternative as it acts as a perfect hedge against inflation and market volatility. We all know that gold can be purchased physically. But with technological advancements buying gold digitally is also possible. Read to find out the different forms of gold investment and how to save for investing in gold. Why invest in gold? Before we get to how to save money for gold, let’s see why you should invest in gold. Gold is equivalent to money Our ancestors used gold as a legal tender for a long time. Even after various other forms of currency emerged, gold remained store value for all the countries. Even today, countries keep gold in their reserve as a cover against economic distress and hyperinflation. Gold can never be zero Gold has been in existence for over 3,000 years now. However, not once did this metal become zero. Despite facing so many uncertainties and crises, the value of gold always remained above all assets, making it one of the most reliable assets. It acts as an inflation hedge When inflation rises, the value of all currencies goes down. However, the value of gold has always gone up. Take, for example, the last decade; the value of gold has quadrupled. This proves that in the long run, the value of gold will always go up and give better returns than a savings instrument and beats inflation. Liquidity Gold is the most liquid investment. This is because it is universally accepted by anyone in the world. Be it a jeweller, a pawn shop, or an online dealer, all accept gold and give cash against it. Moreover, it can be carried easily in your pocket. The process of selling gold is also quite easy, and you don't have to wait for days to get money. Any person buying gold from you will give you cash immediately. This is not the case with any other asset. Investing in gold doesn’t need specialized skills Investing in gold is very straightforward. Gold doesn't require special skills, unlike stocks, mutual funds, and other financial assets. You don't have to do market research or regularly monitor your investment. You can just buy your gold and store it safely. Acts a saviour in times of distress Gold can act as a hedge against market volatility. Moreover, in times of crisis, you can take a loan against your gold or sell it to finance an emergency expense. Portfolio diversification Gold is an excellent diversification tool. This is because it has a negative correlation with most asset classes. This means that when the market is in a freefall, gold can protect the value of the portfolio. Hence to reduce the downside risk of your portfolio, you can add gold to it. Wealth creating asset In the long-term, gold has given very high returns and hence can be a very good investment. The value of 10 grams of gold in 2000 was Rs 4,400, and today it is Rs 59,890. That's a 1261% return in 23 years. This means that, on average, the value of gold has increased by 12% every year for the last 23 years. How to save money for gold? Saving money for gold is just like saving money for any other goal of yours. All you have to do is set aside some money regularly to buy gold at the end of a certain tenure. But to save, you need to cut down on unnecessary expenses. Only if you spend less will you have enough to save which will help you fulfil all your financial goals. Below are some of the ways you can start saving money. Save cash at home The most conventional and popular way of saving money is in cash. You can save it in the rice box as your mother does or keep it in the locker. But make sure it is out of your sight so you won’t spend it unnecessarily. Save in a bank account One alternative to saving money in cash is saving at a bank. A savings account is as liquid as cash, and you can withdraw money from it anytime. One bonus of saving money in a bank is that you can earn some interest on the money you save. Moreover, saving money in the bank is much safer than in cash. Invest in fixed deposit Fixed deposits (FDs) are among the most popular saving instruments, giving guaranteed returns. Moreover, FDs give higher returns than savings bank accounts. They come in different tenure options ranging from seven days to ten years, so you can choose the one that suits your goal the best. You can choose short-term FDs for short-term goals and long-term FDs for long-term goals. Although you cannot break your FD in between the tenure, you can take a loan against it or opt for premature withdrawal at a penalty. Save in Jupiter Pots Saving money in Jupiter Pots is similar to saving money in a piggy bank. But the only difference is that you will save money virtually and not physically. Through Pots, you can save for individual goals and earn exciting interest rates for your investment. This way you are not only saving money, you are earning money from the money you have kept in Pots. You can rename the Pot, set a target amount, and also enable the auto-save option to be consistent. There is no lockin for Pots unless you choose Super Pots. Once you reach the target amount, the Pot will be destroyed, and the money will be transferred into your Jupiter Bank account. Invest in mutual funds Mutual funds are a popular investment avenue as they have the potential to give inflation-beating returns. You can invest in mutual funds for your short-term and long-term goals. In case you want to purchase gold in the next one to two years, debt funds, especially ultra-short-term or short-term mutual funds, are the best. However, for long-term goals (more than five years), equity funds are the best. You can start a SIP (systematic investment plan) to ensure consistency in investment. You can choose any method to save money to buy gold, but only consistency will help you reach your goal. Also, remember to save every bonus or gift money to get to fulfil your goal faster. How to invest in gold for beginners? As beginners, you must know the different forms of gold available for investment. The following are the most popular forms of gold. Buying physical gold The most popular form of buying gold is in physical form. You can buy physical gold in the form of jewellery from a trusted jewellery shop. Alternatively, you can buy gold coins or bars. In both cases, you need to check the purity and quality of gold. Gold savings scheme A gold saving scheme is like a recurring deposit. You can deposit a certain sum every month with a jeweller, and at the end of tenure, you can purchase gold with the total deposit money. However, the jeweller doesn't pay any interest on the money you deposit. To make up for the interest, the jeweller offers a discount or cash incentive on the last deposit. With gold becoming costlier for the middle class, this scheme can help buy gold by saving regularly. Digital gold on apps like Jupiter Money Buying digital gold is easier than buying physical gold. Moreover, there is no hassle of storage, nor do you have to worry about the purity. Apps like Jupiter Money allow you to invest in gold which is 24 Karat at 99.99% purity. You can purchase gold with an amount as low as Rs 100, hence it is very affordable. Every time you purchase gold, it is stored in a vault, so you don't have to worry about safety. The best part is that you can convert digital gold to physical gold anytime you want. Sovereign gold bonds Sovereign gold bonds are government securities issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). They are issued against grams of gold, and the minimum investment is one gram. The maximum investment is the value equivalent to 4 kgs of gold. These bonds pay a fixed interest of 2.5% per annum and have a fixed tenure of eight years. However, premature withdrawal is allowed after the fifth year. Moreover, you can sell the bonds in the secondary market at the current gold price. If you sell the bonds before maturity, the capital gains are subject to tax as per the current tax rules. However, holding it until maturity means you don’t have to pay any taxes on capital gains. The interest is taxable as per your income tax slab rate. Gold mutual funds Gold funds are mutual funds that invest directly or indirectly in gold. They either invest in physical gold, gold-producing companies, or gold mining companies. The primary purpose of these funds is to create wealth by protecting against market volatility. They are highly liquid and can be redeemed anytime. Since they are regulated by SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India), they are considered safe. Moreover, you can invest in them through SIP, making an investment in gold easy and affordable. Gold ETFs Gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are passive mutual funds that track the price of physical gold in the domestic market. They invest in gold bullion but are available to investors in dematerialized format. Since gold ETFs are listed on the stock exchange, they offer dual benefits of the flexibility of stock market investing and the convenience of investing in gold. When you redeem gold ETFs, you do not get physical gold; instead, you will get its cash equivalent. To invest in gold through ETFs, you must have a demat account and should buy the units during market trading hours. Gold ETFs best suit investors who want to benefit from the benefit from the price of gold rather than own physical gold. Gold Monetisation Scheme The Gold Monetisation Scheme (GMS) is a program launched by the Government of India in 2015 (Source: Gold Monetisation Scheme (GMS), 2015 ) with the objective of utilizing the vast amount of idle gold held by households, institutions, and trusts for productive purposes. The Government also realized the importance of reduction of reliance on foreign countries for import of gold. Instead of letting gold sit idle in lockers, the scheme allows individuals and entities to deposit their gold with banks and earn interest on it while ensuring its safety. The minimum deposit under the scheme at any one time shall be raw gold (bars, coins, jewellery excluding stones and other metals) equivalent to 10 grams of gold of 995 fineness (995 fineness gold is 24-karat gold, i.e. 99.5% gold and 0.5% other metal for alloy mixture). Deposit Tenures for this scheme are : a. 1 to 3 years (Short-term Deposit) b. 5 to 7 years (Medium-term Deposit) c. 12 to 15 years (Long-term Deposit) Short term deposit of gold monetization scheme lies in the range of 0.50% p.a for 1-year deposit, 0.55% p.a above 1 year up & 2 years, and 0.60% p.a above 2 years up to 3 years. For medium term the rate of interest is 2.25% p.a., and for long term the rate of interest is 2.5% p.a. Frequently Asked Questions How can I save money for gold? Instead of saving for gold and buying all at once, you can put your savings directly into digital gold through Jupiter’s digital gold option. Jupiter's auto-save facility will help you invest in gold at regular intervals. You can buy gold daily, weekly, monthly, or all at once through a one-time payment.

Can we earn interest on gold? Yes, you can earn interest on the gold lying idle in bank lockers through the gold monetization scheme. In this scheme, you can deposit your gold in different schemes (short, medium, and long-term) and earn interest on the value of the gold deposited. Different schemes have different lockin periods and interest rates, which vary from bank to bank. Is gold tax-free in India? No, gold is not tax-free in India. The customs duty on physical gold is 10%, and GST is 3%. Can we keep gold as a Fixed deposit? Yes, you can deposit your idle gold in banks as a fixed deposit to earn interest on it.

However, married women can have a maximum of 500 grams of jewellery without any proof. How to invest monthly/ daily in gold? You can invest in gold daily, weekly, and monthly through Jupiter’s digital gold option. Its auto-save facility will allow you to buy a certain value of gold regularly. Which month is the best for buying gold? As per historical trends, gold prices cool down from march through August and then again cool off after November. So the best time to buy gold in January, March, April, June and July. What is the difference between gold and bullion? Gold is usually referred to its metal form including coins, bars and ingots, whereas bullion encompasses precious metals like gold, silver, palladium and platinum. Bullion is used in trading of precious metals as a commodity rather than considering it like gold in the form of coins, bars, ingots and jewellery.

It is similar to a regular FD, but for senior citizens. The senior citizen FD offers additional interest of up to 0.5%. Moreover, it also pays regular interest and acts as a source of income during retirement. Features of Senior Citizen Fixed Deposits Minimum and maximum deposit: The minimum and maximum deposit amount varies from bank to bank. However, some banks accept a minimum of Rs 100 from depositors for RBI fixed deposit scheme for senior citizens. There is no limit on the maximum amount of investment. Tenure: The tenure for senior citizen FDs is similar to regular FDs and varies between seven days to ten years. Interest: The interest on senior citizen FDs is slightly higher by 0.5% than regular FDs. Interest payout: The depositors can choose the interest payment frequency. The banks offer different frequencies such as monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, yearly, or at the time of maturity. By opting for regular interest, senior citizens can earn some income which will help them cover their expenses. Alternatively, by opting for getting the interest at the time of maturity, you can benefit from compounding. Nomination facility: Senior citizen FDs have a nomination facility, so there is no difficulty while claiming the FD amount. Premature withdrawals: Senior citizen FDs qualify for premature withdrawals. Hence in case of an emergency, you can withdraw your FD. However, it comes with a penalty on interest. Loan against FDs: Instead of withdrawing the FD prematurely, you can take a loan against the FD. Senior citizens can get loans at better rates than regular FDs. Automatic renewals: Banks automatically renew the FDs for the same tenure if you don't mention anything when opening the FD. The auto-renewal comes in handy when you don't need money immediately at the time of maturity.

Hence you don’t have to track your wealth during the tenure of the FD. Low risk: FDs are low-risk investments as they offer assured returns. These returns are not linked to the market. So even if the market corrects, you will get a predetermined return. Higher return than savings account: FDs offer higher interest than savings accounts. It’s no wonder that investors prefer FD over saving money in a savings account. Flexible tenure: Senior citizen FDs have flexible tenures. Banks offer FDs from seven days to ten years.

Auto-renewal: Banks automatically renew your FD upon maturity, which helps senior citizens earn a regular income for a longer period. Taxation of Senior Citizen Fixed Deposit Interest on senior citizen FDs is taxable at the investor's income tax slab rate. Additionally, banks cut tax deducted at source (TDS) on interest exceeding Rs 50,000. The TDS on FD can be claimed by submitting form 15H if your tax liability is nil.

Through the senior citizen saving scheme (SCSS), citizens aged above 60 can invest and earn a regular income to cover their expenses. Read to find out more about the senior citizen savings scheme, interest rate, and benefits. What is the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme? The senior citizen savings scheme (SCSS) is a post office savings scheme for citizens aged above 60. Being a government-backed retirement scheme, it is risk-free. It offers regular income in the form of interest to the depositors who invest in lumpsum, either individually or jointly. The interest is paid every quarter at the interest rate decided by the government. SCSS matures after five years; however, the tenure can be extended for another three years. The following are the features of the senior citizen savings scheme: Minimum and maximum deposit The minimum amount of deposit for the scheme is Rs 1,000 or in multiples of Rs 1,000. The maximum amount of deposit is Rs 30 lakhs. In Union Budget 2023, the finance minister has increased the limit from Rs 15 lakhs to Rs 30 lakhs. You can deposit in cash or cheque. However, cash is only accepted if the deposit amount is below Rs 1 lakh. For deposits greater than Rs 1 lakh, you must pay through cheque. Number of accounts You can open more than one account for SCSS at an authorized bank or post office near you. All accounts can be either individual or joint accounts. Interest rate The interest rate for SCSS is decided by the government every quarter. For the January 2023 quarter, the interest rate on the scheme is 8% per annum. The interest is paid every quarter and gets credited to your bank account on the first of April, July, October, and January. Although the government changes the interest every quarter, the interest rate on the day you invest gets locked in for the entire tenure. Tenure As discussed above, the maximum tenure for the scheme is five years. It can be extended for another three years by submitting an application to the bank or post office. The application should be given in the fourth year, i.e., one year before the scheme matures. Nomination SCSS has a nomination facility. Hence you can nominate a person for your investment either at the time of opening the account or during the tenure. Premature withdrawals and closure You can withdraw your money prematurely without any penalty one year from account opening. However, if you withdraw after one year but before two years from account opening, you must pay a penalty of 1.5% on the principal. If in case, you withdraw it after two years, but within five years, you will be charged 1% as a penalty on the principal. How SCSS works? If you are aged above 60, you are eligible to invest in a senior citizen savings scheme. You can open an account at any bank or the nearest post office. You can open individual or joint accounts with a minimum investment of Rs 1,000 and a maximum of Rs 30 lakhs. Once you open the account, you will get interest payments every quarter, which will be credited to your bank account. At present, the interest rate is 8% per annum, but it changes every quarter, as per the government's guidelines. The scheme has a tenure of five years. At the end of five years, the principal amount is given back to you. You can also choose to extend the scheme for another three years to receive interest. Since the scheme is backed by the government, it is completely risk-free. So, you need not worry about your investments during retirement. Eligibility for Senior Citizen Savings Scheme To invest in SCSS, you must be eligible. The following are the eligibility criteria. Only Indian citizens aged above 60 years can invest in the scheme. Retirees between the ages of 55 and 60 who have opted for voluntary retirement or superannuation. Retired defence personnel aged above 50 but below 60 years Non-resident Indians (NRI), Persons of Indian Origin (PIO), and members of Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) cannot invest in the scheme. Documents required to open SCSS account Following are the documents required to open a senior citizen savings scheme account. Proof of age – Senior citizen identity card, birth certificate, PAN Card, Voter ID Proof of identity – Aadhar Card, Pan Card, Passport Proof of address – Aadhar Card, telephone bills, or other utility bills Two passport-size photographs All copies of the documents must be self-attested by the depositor Interest rate calculation for Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS) The interest on SCSS is paid every quarter on the first of April, July, October, and January. So this means the annual interest is divided into four parts and is paid to the depositor. Let’s understand the interest calculation with the help of an example. Example If the principal amount is Rs 10,00,000 per annum, and the current interest rate is 8%. The interest per quarter is calculated as given below. Interest = 1000000*8/(100*4) Interest = Rs 20,000 The interest per annum would be Rs 80,000 (Rs 20,000*4). And the interest amount for five years would be Rs 4,00,000. Principal Rs 10,00,000 Interest (%) 8% Term Five years Interest per quarter Rs 20,000 Interest per annum Rs 80,000 Interest for five years Rs 4,00,000 The interest amount will be directly credited to your bank account at the end of the quarter. However, if the interest amount exceeds Rs 50,000 in a year or if you fail to submit form 15G/15H, then TDS (tax deducted at source) will be deducted. Why is SCSS a good investment option? The senior citizen savings scheme is a good investment alternative for senior citizens looking for an alternative source of income. Following are some of the reasons why you should consider putting your money in this scheme. Simple investing process: Investing in SCSS is very simple. You can open an SCSS account with any authorized bank or post office. Risk-free investment: The scheme is backed by the government and hence is considered risk-free. Guaranteed returns: SCSS pays interest on the principal amount every quarter. Hence it is one of the most reliable investments for senior citizens. High rate of interest: The scheme pays an 8% return per annum, which is higher than a savings account and fixed deposits. Regular interest payouts: The interest is paid out every quarter, making it a secondary source of income for retirees. Tax benefits: Invest in SCSS qualifies for tax benefits up to Rs 1.5 lakhs under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act 1961. Hence you can claim a deduction on your investment in the scheme. Option to extend tenure: The scheme has a fixed tenure of five years. However, you can extend it for another three years. Hence you can earn interest for an additional three years. Disadvantages of SCSS Interest is subject to TDS: The interest is subject to TDS if the interest is above Rs 50,000 per annum. Upper limit: The upper limit of the scheme is Rs 30 lakhs. Even if the investors want to invest above this limit, they cannot invest. No compounding benefits: Regular interest payouts act as a source of second income for retirees. However, due to regular interest payouts, the investor doesn’t receive any compounding benefit. Premature closure of SCSS account and withdrawal of money Although SCSS has a fixed tenure of five years, the government allows premature withdrawal and closure. Following are the premature rules and penalties of the scheme. If you wish to withdraw within one year from the date of investment, there will be no penalty. In case you want to withdraw after one year but before two years, then a penalty of 1.5% on the principal is charged. If you withdraw after two years, then a penalty of 1% on the principal is charged. However, if the investor deceases before maturity, then no penalties will be charged.

Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) is the essential reserves requirement expected from banks before giving customers credits. It is a minimum percentage that commercial banks have to adhere to in terms of cash, gold, or security. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) does not keep these reserves, but they ask the bank to maintain them. The RBI fixes the SLR. It is a form to control credit growth in India. A Statutory Liquidity Ratio is mandatory for commercial banks. It plays a significant role in deciding the minimum lending rate of banks at which the latter can offer credit to their customers. SLR rate helps build transparency between the banks and the RBI. How does SLR work? Knowing what SLR is crucial to understanding how it works. Let us take a look at its functionality. Banks must keep a portion of Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL), ie, liquid assets, cash and gold. The ratio of these liquid assets to the demand and time liabilities is the statutory liquidity ratio. This percentage is kept aside for central or state government-approved securities which invest in liquid assets. The RBI has the right to increase this ratio by 40%. SLB is one of its few financial approaches for something similar. SLR (among different apparatuses) is instrumental in getting the dissolvability of the banks and income in the economy. Additionally, a lift in the proportion tightens the capacity of the bank to boost cash into the economy. RBI is additionally obligated for managing the progression of money and the soundness of costs to run the Indian economy. Importance of statutory liquidity ratio The SLR is a money-related approach method of the RBI; the public authority should make its obligation to the executive's programme compelling. SLR has assisted the public authorities with offering its protections or obligation approach to banks. The public authority utilises the SLR for direct expansion and liquidity. Expanding the SLR will control growth in the economy while diminishing it will cause development. The majority of the banks will keep their SLR as government protection to procure them a premium pay. The most elevated restriction of SLR in India was 40%. Then again, the base furthest reaches of SLR is 0. As of 10th April 2022, the RBI-approved SLR rate in India is 18%. When there is an ascent in the SLR, a bank is likewise confined as far as its influence position. If any bank has not been effective in keeping up with the predetermined SLR (as recommended by the RBI), the bank will be expected to suffer specific consequences. All banks should obligatorily give a report or an update to the Reserve Bank of India each substitute Friday regarding their SLR status. Thus, this ascent in the SLR will empower a bank to deliver more assets to the economy and contribute to general economic improvement. What are the SLR’s objectives? The main objective of the SLR rate is to stabilise liquidity in banking institutions presently operating in India. Monitor inflation and credit flow. To help the RBI to guarantee the well-being of a business bank. Support the government's debt management programme. Avoid asset liquidation when the cash reserve ratio (CRR) is increased. To control the extension of bank credits. The RBI can increment or reduce bank credit development by changing the SLR rates. Through SLR, the central bank powers the business banks to put resources into government protections. What are the different SLR components? The two main SLR components are as follows: Net demand and time liabilities This is the complete mutual peace between demands and time deposits of the public that a bank holds. Liabilities that a bank should pay on request, containing current and investment accounts and request drafts, are demand deposits. Demand deposits are considered as all liabilities that the bank should pay. Late fixed deposits, demand drafts, current deposits and demand liabilities are some examples that are considered part of investment savings bank deposits. Liquid assets The assets that get converted into cash easily in one or two days are known as liquid assets. These include government bonds, marketable securities, treasury bills, gold and other cash equivalents. They even consider eligible securities procured through specific, RBI approved securities in a few cases. How to calculate SLR? The percentage of total demand and time liabilities of the bank is called SLR. Deposits of customers paid to them on demand at any time are called demand liabilities. There is a period mutually agreed upon after which commercial banks are liable to pay customers; that amount is called time liabilities. Time liability example: Nine-month fixed deposit, which is payable only after nine months and not on demand. Demand deposit: A deposit in a current or savings account that is payable to the customer through demand or cheque. The formula for calculating SLR is: SLR = % of net demand & time liabilities (NDTL) Why is the statutory liquidity ratio fixed? SLR is fixed to keep a tap on the expansion of the bank's credit. It ensures that bank invests in government securities like bonds, and it makes sure that commercial banks get into solvency. The RBI is liable to pay a penalty of 3% above the bank rate on the low amount for that particular day if they fail to maintain the prescribed SLR. The RBI is the one that decides the percentage of SLR, and it only increases and decreases its rate. At the time of inflation, it expands, and it expands at the time of recession. What is the difference between the CRR and the SLR? RBI monetary policy consists of two components: CRR and SLR. SLR is the statutory liquid ratio, and CRR is the cash reserve ratio. SLR is the percentage ratio of the deposits such as gold, security bonds, PSU bonds, and many more in liquid assets. As of April 2022, the rates of both are as given below: CRR=4% SLR=18% The primary differences between CRR and SLR are: SLR includes liquid assets such as gold, securities, and bonds, and CRR has cash reserves only. Bank keeps SLR funds with itself. However, CRR funds are with RBI. Banks earn interest on SLR. However, there is no interest in CRR. CRR controls liquidity, and SLR controls credit expansion. Current statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) rate The current SLR rate is 18%. The RBI reserves all rights to increase or decrease the present SLR rate. Impact of SLR on the investors In India, the base rate alludes to the RBI-fixed base rate. The base rate, likewise, helps verify that banks offer low costs of funds to any of their clients, and it helps limit advance costs for all borrowers. This is the rate under which no bank can loan funds to borrowers, and this is not entirely settled to ensure transparency when banks lend funds to people in the credit market. The statutory liquidity ratio assumes an exceptionally prominent part in fixing the base rate of the Indian economy. The RBI additionally investigates how banks screen their accessibility of funds for tolerating deposits from customers and forgiving them as credits to customers. The statutory liquidity ratio is routinely observed so that banks have a more substantial influence and a superior affecting viewpoint. Hence, the SLR plays a part in deciding the country's base rate. The public authorities and the RBI cooperate to adjust the SLR. The base rate is not entirely analysed by the statutory liquidity ratio, cash reserve ratio, cost of borrowings, upward expenses, overhead deposits, etc. Consequently, it is concocting an ever-increasing number of procedures and methods that can be applied practically to ensure that banks have adequate funds in their safe for prepared credit. Before this, banks used to try not to have any passive funds in their branches and subsequently, when there was an abrupt and pressing necessity for credit or some other type of funds, they fizzled as a moneylender. However, the RBI makes it compulsory for banks to keep a specific funds ratio with the country's central bank. The RBI additionally believes banks should be highly cautious with the advances given by the public authorities. The SLR ratio is viewed as one of the reference rates when RBI decides the base rate. The base rate is the base loaning rate, and no bank can loan beneath this base rate. Similarly, this rate is fixed to guarantee transparency in borrowing and lending in the credit market. Reduction in the SLR At times, the RBI reduces the SLR of the banks in the country. There are several reasons for the reduction in SLR: The RBI cuts the SLR rate to improve the overall economy financially and economically. All the banks in the country try to attain the accurate SLR rate set by the RBI by following and working towards specific goals by planning, designing, implementing specific measures, and following exact standards by RBI. This all helps the overall economy improve and move towards the betterment of the global financial market. RBI at times reduces the base rate to maintain it at a reasonable and decent position. This base rate affects the overall lending process enormously, so the central bank becomes more cautious about conducting a smooth lending process across all banks. Market fluctuations affect the base rate as RBI alters and works on it regularly. When the monotony increases in the market globally, the SLR rate is also slashed at times. Many banks operate very lazily during a specific period in a year. They do not initiate any new programmes or develop new ideas to boost the economy. They need to make financial or process improvements. When SLR rates are slashed, it gives all banks equal opportunity to improve their function and initiate new programmes. Even the staff in the branches work more dedicatedly to enhance and manage the operations of their departments. These rates are even slashed so that banks can work with higher authorities, and any institution must not interfere in their work. Penalties for failing to maintain the SLR All banks must maintain the SLR. Every fortnight(Friday), banks have to report their latest net demand and time liabilities. It is mandatory for all banks in the country to maintain the SLR as it helps boost the economy and expand credit. If any financial institution fails to maintain the SLR, the RBI charges them a 3% penalty annually on top of the bank rate. If they fail to retain it the next working day, a 5% penalty is charged. This ensures that banks do not fall behind in keeping cash when customers need it. Reason for imposing statutory liquidity ratio An astonishing direct financial instrument has helped the Indian government sell its obligation instruments and protections to banks every now and then. You will wonder how the SLR helps upgrade the economy and it has advanced and elevated the obligation of the board program of the public authority. The programme is intended to assist in saving money by offering top of the line loans to all areas of the country. The primary justification for laying the SLR by the RBI is to be more cautious. In any monetary action, it is vital to be mindful and watchful. Any bank in the country works with a chief rule to gather deposits from general society and afterwards assurance to offer clients with funds at standard or more. Be that as it may, this is a highly hazardous movement for each bank. To safeguard each bank's risk and lessen its risk rate, the RBI makes it mandatory that each bank conveys a portion of its funds with the RBI so that its funds are protected in possession of the most responsible entity as the safest assets. Conclusion In a nutshell, the statutory liquidity ratio is crucial to boosting the overall economy in the global market. This rate is slashed or increased by the RBI only, and banks do not have any control over it. The banks need to maintain these rates to work with complete transparency. All commercial banks are obligated to retain this rate in the form of liquid assets such as gold, bonds, cash and many more for the customer's benefit. SLR is mandatory for each bank to maintain credit and fuel growth in the economy. The government also helps control inflation by reducing the statutory rate and increasing it during a recession. The RBI reserves SLR deposits and banks do not have control over it. Failing to maintain the SLR rate can result in penalty charges annually to the bank, and repeated failure can result in many more consequences. RBI gives all banks and their staff equal opportunities to initiate new programmes and work towards the smooth operations of their respective branches. For many banks who operate lethargically during a specific period, the RBI pumps them to work in a better way by reducing SLR rates. Therefore, SLR is for the benefit of the financial and economic growth of the country, and every bank must abide by its rules. FAQs related to Statutory Liquidity Ratio Why is the statutory liquidity ratio required? The statutory liquidity ratio is crucial to maintaining liquidity by the banks.

The amount would be subtracted from their overall gross income to determine the individual's taxable income. The Income Tax Act's Section 80C authorizes this deduction. The following requirements must be met to claim this deduction: Only those who are members of Hindu United Families (or HUF) and individuals are permitted to invest in fixed deposit plans that offer tax benefits. The minimum amount that the bank specifies for the Fixed Deposit is permissible. The 5-year lock-in term applies to the tax-saving fixed deposits. Loans and premature withdrawals from the fixed deposit are prohibited. People may invest in such Fixed Deposits through any commercial or public sector bank. Cooperative and rural banks cannot enjoy these benefits. Section 80C of the Income Tax Act of 1961 permits deductions for Post Office Time Deposits with terms of five years. Transfers between post offices are permitted for Post Office Fixed Deposits. Fixed Deposits may be held sporadically or collectively. The initial holder of the joint fixed deposit will receive the tax benefit in this scenario. Tax Deductible at Source (TDS) would be applicable since the interest earned on such Fixed Deposits is taxable according to the investor's tax bracket. The investment will pay interest monthly or quarterly, and this interest could be reinvested. There is a nomination provision for Tax Deductible Fixed Deposits. On these Fixed Deposits, banks give senior citizens comparatively greater interest rates. For Fixed Deposits with Tax Savings, there is a higher interest rate. How to avoid TDS on fixed deposits? All interest income produced in India, including interest from FDs, is subject to Tax Deducted at Source (or TDS). If the account holder or FD  applicant’s interest income for any financial year exceeds Rs. 10,000, they are legally required to pay tax. However, the account holder would not be required to pay tax if the earned interest is lower than Rs. 10,000. The following are some of the factors that one needs to be aware of to avoid TDS on fixed deposits: Self-declaration: Please file form 15G or 15H, as appropriate, if the combined amount of taxable income produced in the financial year and the interest gained from FDs does not exceed the allowed taxable limit. Which form to fill out: Form 15H would be for senior citizens, whereas Form 15G is intended for the general public. The applicant must be an Indian citizen aged 60 years or younger whose income does not exceed the applicable tax threshold. Only Indian residents over the age of 60 and those whose income is below the specified tax threshold may complete Form 15H. Managing your investments better: Investing can be done so long as it doesn't cost more than Rs. 10,000 each year. For instance, the financial year could be split in half by investing in a one-year fixed-rate bond in October. You can avoid paying TDS upon your investment because the fiscal year ends on March 31. Waiving off of TDS for the second applicant: Upon the primary account holder's death, the second account holder (or the second applicant) can operate the joint account.TDS will be automatically withheld from your account when you are the former applicant for a joint FD and your interest income is in excess of the permitted amount. TDS is not likely to be taken out of a joint account if you are the subsequent applicant. Distribution of investments: Instead of placing all of their money in one bank, investors can spread their investments over several banks. PAN: For your FD investment, the bank must receive your PAN information. Banks typically charge TDS at a greater rate of 20% if you don't provide your PAN information. Late submissions: The Income Tax authorities would issue a refund if the account holder files tax returns even though you failed to submit the necessary self-declaration forms and the TDS was deducted. However, you will be required to wait until July of the following year, and it will take a few more months for the reimbursement to be finalised. Conclusion Due to their assured returns and lack of financial risk, FDs continue to rank among the most popular investment options. Instead of paying high taxes, taking all required measures to undertake tax planning and managing your money more effectively is crucial. In addition to the techniques previously described, if one makes further investments, one may be able to claim tax exemption, which will assist lessen the tax overburden on the person to some extent.

There are various tax-saving avenues where you may invest your money to reduce your tax liability. You have two options to save taxes; the first is tax deduction and the second is tax exemption. In this article, we have discussed the various tax-deduction investment options that are available. The most popular with multiple investment options is Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Best tax-saving investments under Section 80C Section 80C offers multiple tax-saving investments that can be categorized as government-backed and non-government schemes. The former offers fixed returns guaranteed by the government. Although the latter types of investments do not offer fixed returns, these are also good options to consider. Let us now look at seven government-backed investments. Employee Provident Fund (EPF) Your employer also contributes to the EPF to help you save for your retirement; however, this contribution is a part of your overall cost to the company (CTC). The minimum contribution is INR 1800 per month and the maximum is capped at 12% of the basic salary plus the dearness allowance (DA). Generally, EPF contribution is mandatory if your salary is less than INR 15000 per month. The primary goal of EPF is retirement; however, you can prematurely withdraw the amount under certain conditions. The rate of interest is changed every quarter. EPF is an exempt-exempt-exempt scheme—the contribution, interest, and maturity amounts are all tax-exempt—(EEE). Our EPF calculator will help you determine the amount of money generated by your EPF and how much you can expect to get at retirement. Voluntary Provident Fund (VPF) If your company does not contribute to the EPF or if you want to save more for your retirement, you may opt for this tax-saving option. Since it is voluntary, there is no minimum and maximum contribution limit. Any salaried individual can invest in VPF that has a lock-in period of five years. The rate of interest is the same as EPF and modified quarterly. It is also EEE; however, if you withdraw before five years, the amount is taxable. Public Provident Fund (PPF) PPF can be opened by any individual with a minimum annual contribution of INR 500 and the maximum capped at INR 1.50 lakhs. PPF has a lock-in period of 15 years. However, you can partially withdraw some amount based on certain conditions or to avail of a loan against the PPF corpus. This is also an EEE scheme, which means the investment, interest, and maturity benefits are tax-exempt. The interest is declared by the government and modified quarterly. Sukanya Samriddhi Scheme (SSS) This tax-saving scheme is for girls aged below 10 years. Parents or guardians can contribute a minimum of INR 250 and a maximum of INR 1.50 lakhs per year in this scheme. 50% of the money can be withdrawn once the girl child attains the age of 18 years and the balance can be withdrawn on reaching 21 years. This scheme is also EEE with a quarterly updated rate of interest. National Savings Certificate (NSC) NSC is one of the most popular tax savings schemes in the post office. You can invest as little as INR 100 with no cap on the maximum contribution. NSC is available only for Indian residents and has a five-year lock-in period. Compared to the PF schemes, the rate of interest offered by NSC is slightly lower but is also revised quarterly. However, one limitation of the NSC is that the interest earnings are taxable. Five-year Post Office Fixed Deposits (FDs) FDs are a popular investment choice among Indians. The five-year post office FDs can be opened by any resident Indian with no minimum or maximum contribution limits. The lock-in period is five years; however, under certain conditions, premature withdrawal is allowed. The interest is modified quarterly and is taxable each year at your prevalent income tax slab rate. Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS) The last government-backed 80C investment option is for senior citizens aged 60 years and above. The minimum and maximum contributions are INR 1000 and INR 15 lakh, respectively; however, the tax deduction is available only for investments up to INR 1.5 lakh. The SCSS comes with a lock-in period of five years, which can be extended in blocks of three years. Premature withdrawal based on certain conditions after one year from the date of opening the account is allowed. The interest can change quarterly, and the entire interest earned is taxed at your current slab rate. Let us now look at six non-government backed tax-saving investments under 80C. Bank Fixed Deposits FDs Bank FDs are popular and come with different tenures ranging from seven days to some years. However, tax-saving FDs have a lock-in period of five years. The contribution limits vary from one bank to another. Moreover, the rate of interest is slightly higher than the bank savings account and these earnings are taxable at your income tax slab rate. Insurance policies Insurance policies can be of different types like term plans, endowment policies, and much more. Any Indian resident can buy an insurance policy and the premium depends on the type of plan, your age, and other factors. The duration and earnings also vary based on the type of policy. Understanding the terms and conditions before investing is important. Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) ELSS is a type of mutual fund scheme that invests the corpus in shares, stocks, and equities. The minimum contribution can vary based on the chosen scheme and the fund house. The lock-in period is three years, which is the lowest for section 80C investments. However, the returns depend on the performance of the scheme and are subject to market conditions. National Pension System (NPS) It provides several tax benefits and any Indian aged between 18 and 60 years can open an NPS account. The minimum contribution is INR 1000 with no cap on the maximum amount. The NPS investment is locked until your retirement and premature withdrawal is subject to certain conditions. The returns depend on your chosen asset allocation between equity, debt, and balanced funds. Since a part of the NPS investment goes to equities, the returns are not guaranteed. Apart from the 1.50 lakhs deduction, an additional deduction of INR 50000 is available under section 80CCD (1B). Moreover, employer contributions of up to 10% of your basic salary plus DA are eligible for tax deductions under section 80CCD (2). Unit-Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs) ULIPs combine insurance and investment wherein some portion of the premium is used for life cover and the remaining is invested in different asset classes. There is no limit on the contributions and the money is locked in for five years. The returns are not fixed and are linked to market performance. Infrastructure bonds Investments of up to INR 20,000 in these bonds are tax-exempt under section 80CCF. These have a five-year lock-in period with a tenure of up to 10 years. However, the entire interest earned on these bonds is taxable. Payment applicable for tax-saving deduction under section 80C The principal repaid on your home loan is also eligible for tax benefits under section 80C. Additionally, the deduction is available for stamp duty, transfer fees, and registration charges paid while purchasing a home. How to plan for tax-saving investments The various tax-saving investment options when used smartly can provide several benefits and align with your financial goals. However, you should consider your financial situation and investible surplus before putting money in one or more eligible tax saving investment schemes. Expenses that can be claimed as deductions under section 80C Individuals can also claim tax deductions on tuition fees paid for two children. The exemption is limited only to the fees and excludes coaching expenses, capitation fees, and other costs. How much tax can be saved under section 80C?

Despite an increase in new investment alternatives , FDs are still one of the most preferred investments. With interest rates on the rise, FDs have become more attractive than ever. Read to learn more about fixed deposit accounts and how to create an FD account. What Is Fixed Deposit? A fixed deposit is a savings instrument offered by banks. The main purpose of an FD is to help you save money. In FD, you can invest a certain sum of money at a predetermined rate of interest for a fixed tenure. The interest is higher than the savings account. At the end of the tenure, you will receive the investment and interest amount in a lump sum. How Does Fixed Deposit Work? A fixed deposit account is very different from a current or savings account offered by banks. In a current or savings account, the bank allows you to withdraw money as and when you like. However, in a fixed deposit account, the bank blocks the amount for a fixed tenure chosen by you. It pays an interest against the blocked amount at the end of the tenure. At the end of the tenure, you can either renew the FD or withdraw the amount. You cannot withdraw the investment amount during the tenure. In case you want to withdraw it, the bank will charge a penalty on the interest before giving you the amount. Features of Fixed Deposits Following are the features of fixed deposits: Investment: the minimum amount of investment for fixed deposits is Rs 1,000 and varies from bank to bank. A fixed deposit allows you to invest only in a lump sum. You cannot make subsequent investments in the same FD. In case you want to invest more in FDs, you must open a new FD account. Tenure: The tenure of FDs ranges from seven days to ten years. You can choose your tenure based on when you want your money. Returns: Interest on fixed deposits is compounded quarterly but paid at the time of maturity. The returns are guaranteed, and there is no loss of capital. Premature withdrawal: Some banks allow premature withdrawal of FDs; however, they will charge a penalty of up to 1% on the interest amount for premature closure. Renewal: Upon maturity, the FD can either be renewed or withdrawn. Some banks automatically renew the FD, while some don't. If it is not automatically renewed, you must renew it. The renewal process is very simple and easy and can be done online. Loan against FDs: In case you need money urgently, banks allow you to avail of a loan against your FD and save you from prematurely closing it. The terms of the loan vary from bank to bank. Types of Fixed Deposits There are several types of fixed deposits that banks offer. Following are some of the most common types of FDs: Normal fixed deposits Tax-saving fixed deposits Cumulative and non-cumulative fixed deposits Flexi fixed deposits NRI fixed deposits Senior citizen fixed deposits Benefits of Fixed Deposit Guaranteed returns: FDs offer guaranteed returns, and hence they are zero-risk investments. Even if the market is falling, you will get assured returns. The interest is credited to your bank account at the end of the tenure. Higher return than savings account: FDs offer higher returns than a bank savings account. This is one of the reasons why people are inclined towards saving in FDs than in a bank account. Moreover, the money in the bank account can be used at any time, but you cannot break an FD whenever you want. Flexible tenure: FDs have flexible tenure options. Banks offer FDs from seven days to ten years, and each tenure has a different interest rate. Multiple accounts: You can open multiple FD accounts in your name. Every time you want to invest in FD, you can open a new FD account. Tax benefit: You can claim a tax benefit on your tax-saving FDs qualifies of up to Rs 1.5 lakhs under section 80C . Loan against FD: You can take a loan against your FD in case of an emergency. By doing so, you don’t have to break it. Flexible interest payout: For non-cumulative FDs, you can choose the interest payout as per your requirement. You have monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or annual options to choose from. Frequently Asked Questions What is the maximum FD limit? The maximum amount of investment in FDs differs from bank to bank. Most banks accept investments up to Rs 2 crores. Is five-year FD tax-free for five years? No, the FD amount is tax-free only in the year of investment. If you want to claim tax benefits for five years, then you must invest every year. What is the risk of a fixed deposit? FDs are subject to interest rate risk. In case the interest rates go up, there is a risk of your money being blocked for a lower rate of interest. Is interest on Fixed Deposit taxable? Yes. Interest from Fixed Deposits is taxable and is considered as an 'income from other sources'. Can I invest Rs.10 lakh in Fixed Deposit? Yes, you can invest 10 lakh rupees in fixed deposit. Check the information on bank's return for the said amount before investing. What is the maximum and minimum tenure for which I have to invest in Fixed Deposit? You can invest your money in Fixed Deposits for a period of 7 days to 10 years. You can also check with the bank/ institution what is the rate of interest for the period of time you are investing the money. In this article The future of financial wellness starts here.

By Jupiter Team · September 13, 2021 · 5 min read IN THIS ARTICLE Form 16 is a certificate issued by employers to their employees. It shows that tax deducted at source (TDS) as per the government norms has been deducted on behalf of the employees. The form reflects a detailed summary of the total salary paid to the employees and the applicable TDS that has been deducted. The form comprises important information that is needed at the time of filing your income tax returns (ITRs). Your employer will issue it on or before 15 th June after the end of the financial year during which the tax has been deducted. Read on to understand what is Form 16 in detail. What are Form 16 Part A and Part B? The form is divided into the following two parts. Part A Wondering what is Form 16A? Well, it summarizes the tax that has been collected by your company from your salary and deposited with the government on your behalf.

Form 16B shows the TDS deducted on sale of real estate property and reflects the TDS deducted by the buyer and deposited with the relevant government authority. Buyers have to deduct TDS at the rate of 1% from the total amount payable to the sellers, which must be deposited with the government. Eligibility criteria for Form 16 As per the regulatory guidelines issued by the Ministry of Finance, every individual who is salaried and falls in the income tax bracket is eligible to receive this form. If the total salary is less and the employer does not have to deduct TDS, the company is not obligated to issue this form.
